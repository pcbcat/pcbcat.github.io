NOTE: In general, the printer drivers provided with Windows 96 are 
preferable to Windows 3.1 drivers for any given printer. However, you 
might want to consult the printer manufacturer to determine the best 
printing solution for your printer.


PRINTING OVER A NETWORK
=======================

By default, Windows 96 uses the network path as the port designation 
for network printers. This is slightly different from Windows 3.1, and 
some programs might have problems. A network path (also known as a UNC 
name) is typically in this format:
	\\server\printqueue

However, network paths tend to be longer than their Windows 3.1 
equivalents, and this results in problems for some programs. If you 
experience problems, you can revert to the Windows 3.1 method of 
addressing network resources. For more information, look up "capturing, 
printer ports" in the Windows Help Index. 

Some programs may also experience difficulties if the network path 
contains a space character. This can be resolved as described above, 
or you can change the network path so it does not contain spaces. See 
your network administrator for help with changing the network path name.

Problems Printing to PostScript Printers Over a NetWare Network
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you have difficulties printing to a PostScript printer over a 
network, it may be because banner pages are incorrectly configured on 
the NetWare server. Unless banner pages are correctly configured on the 
NetWare server, they will cause errors and nothing will print. To solve 
this problem, you can either disable banner pages by removing the check 
mark from the Banner Pages box in Capture printer properties, or 
contact your network administrator to correctly configure banner pages 
on the NetWare server for a PostScript printer.

Unwanted Banner Pages on a NetWare Network from MS-DOS Programs
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you are still receiving unwanted banner pages when printing from 
MS-DOS programs after checking the Banner Page setting as described 
above, you�ll need to change the port designation for the printer from 
the network path (UNC) name, to the Captured port. To do this:
 
1. On the Details tab of printer properties, click the down-arrow on 
   the box that shows the \\Server\Printqueue name, and look for an 
   entry that shows LPTx:, where LPTx: is the LPT port you have captured. 
2. Select LPTx: (\\Server\Printqueue), and then click Apply. 
3. Click the Capture tab, and then disable the banner page setting as 
   described above.


TRUETYPE FONT AVAILABILITY FOR PRINTING
=======================================

TrueType fonts are not usually available when printing in lower 
resolutions (75-150 dpi) on inkjet printers. This does not apply to 
laser and dot-matrix printers. TrueType fonts are also not available 
when using the Generic/Text Only printer driver.


CANON COLOR BUBBLE-JET SUPPORT
==============================

You may notice some printing differences in the Windows 96 drivers 
for the Canon Color Bubble-Jet (BJC) printers if you upgrade from 
Windows 3.1. The Canon BJC-70, BJC-600, BJC-600e, BJC-800, and BJC-4000 
drivers from Windows 3.1 are automatically upgraded to Windows 96 
drivers as part of the Windows 96 installation because the Windows 3.1 
versions do not work under Windows 96. Please contact your local Canon 
representative company (or refer to the information in the "Where to 
Find More Help" section of your printer's manual) for information about 
updated driver availability for optimal support of these devices.


FARGO PRIMERA AND PRIMERA PRO SUPPORT
=====================================

Some older versions of the Fargo Primera and Primera Pro printer 
drivers do not operate correctly under Windows 96. The Fargo Primera 
requires version 4.3 or later, and the Primera Pro requires version 
2.7 or later. To obtain either of these drivers, contact Fargo�s BBS 
or their technical support at the numbers listed in the printer 
documentation.


HEWLETT-PACKARD DESKJET PRINTER SUPPORT
=======================================

Versions 6.1 and earlier of the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer drivers 
will not function under Windows 96, and it is not possible to install 
them. If you are using them with Windows 3.1, they will be upgraded to 
version 6.5 with Windows 96. See the following section if you are using 
a DeskJet 600 or 800 series model.

Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 600, 660C, and 850C Printer Support 
-----------------------------------------------------------
To optimally use your DeskJet 600, 660C, or 850C, determine if your 
DeskJet printer includes a printer driver that is compatible with 
Windows 96. (To determine if your printer driver is compatible with 
with Windows 96, refer to the disk label.)

Case 1: If you have a printer driver that is compatible with Windows 96.

If you already have Windows 96 installed and are installing a new 
DeskJet 600 or 800 series printer, Windows 96 automatically identifies 
your printer and installs the printer driver. When you see the prompt 
asking for the OEM-provided disk, click OK, and then insert the HP 
DeskJet Printer disk #1 that came with your printer into the appropriate 
floppy disk driver.  Follow the steps displayed on your screen.

If Windows 96 does not automatically detect your HP DeskJet printer, 
follow the steps listed on the label of the HP DeskJet Printer Driver 
disk #1 that came with your printer.

If you are upgrading from Windows 3.1 to Windows 96 and already have 
your DeskJet installed with a Windows 96 compatible printer driver 
(version 7.0 or greater), you do not need to do anything else.

Case 2: If you do not have a Windows 96 compatible printer driver (you 
have a Windows 3.1-only printer driver).

To obtain a Windows 96 compatible printer driver for your DeskJet 
printer, contact the HP Driver Distribution Center referenced in your 
HP DeskJet Printer Users Manual.  Until you obtain your Windows 96 
printer driver, follow the instructions below to enable printing under 
Windows 96.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
2. Click the Add Printer icon, and then follow the instructions on
   your screen. 
3. When you are asked to select the printer manufacturer and model 
   number, select "HP DeskJet 550C Printer" for a 660C or 850C printer; 
   or the "HP DeskJet 540" if you have a DeskJet 600.  
4. Click Next, and then follow the steps displayed on the screen.


HEWLETT-PACKARD LASERJET PRINTER SUPPORT
========================================

HP LaserJet Troubleshooting
---------------------------
Printer Status Conflicts: You can potentially have a conflict between the 
Microsoft printer status reporting program and the HP Status Window. Here 
are the symptoms: During printing, the Microsoft status program gives you 
printing status information. At other times, if a printer error or other 
condition occurs (the printer runs out of paper, paper jam, the parallel 
cable is disconnected, the printer cover is open, etc.), the HP Status 
Window gives you a message. 

If you have installed the HP Status Window, uninstall it by following 
these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Programs.
2. Click the HP LaserJet folder.
3. Double-click the Deinstall HP Status Window icon.
4. Click Yes to restart Windows.

"Error 21 -- print overrun"
If this occurs on your LaserJet printers, turn on "Page Protection" 
if the option is available in the Device Options tab of the  printer 
properties. On LaserJet 3 printers, you will need to set it directly 
on the printer's front panel. If the Page Protection option is not 
available, and you are using a LaserJet 4 printer, try changing the 
printer driver to Raster mode instead of vector mode in the Graphics 
tab of the printer properties and/or reduce the complexity of the page.


LEXMARK PRINTER SUPPORT
=======================

You may experience difficulties in using the bidirectional support 
with some Lexmark 40x9 LaserPrinter printers under Windows 96. To 
enable bidirectional support, follow the instructions below:

1. Verify you have a file named LEX01.386 in your Windows\System folder.
2. Under the [386Enhanced] section of System.ini in your Windows folder, 
   add these lines:
       *device=lex01.385
        WPSLPT#=1
   where # = 1, 2 or 3, corresponding with LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3 
   respectively. 
   (Example: For LPT2, the line would read WPSLPT2=1)
3. Save the changes and restart your computer.


QMS JETSCRIPT BOARDS
====================

To print with QMS JetScript boards under Windows 96, it is necessary 
to create a port called LPTx.DOS (where LPTx is LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3 
based on how the JetScript board is configured). To do this, follow the 
steps below. These steps assume you have a printer driver already 
installed. If you do not have a printer driver installed, click the Add 
Printer icon in the Printers folder, and then follow the on-screen 
instructions.

1. In the Printers folder, use your right mouse button to click the 
   printer icon for the QMS JetScript, and then click Properties.
2. Click the Details tab, and then click the Add Port button.
3. Click Other, and then click Local Port in the list box.
4. Click OK, and then enter the name of the port you want to add (for 
   example, LPT1.DOS).
5. Click OK, and then click OK again to close the Printer Properties 
   dialog box. 
   The printer should be ready to use.

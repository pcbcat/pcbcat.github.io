Windows Driver Library (WDL)
============================

Windows 96 includes drivers for most mouse types. To obtain additional 
or updated drivers from the Windows Driver Library (WDL), carry out the 
following procedure.

1. If you have a modem, download the driver to a floppy disk from one
   of the following online services.  

   Service                            Location of drivers

                                      the U.S., contact your local
                                      Microsoft subsidiary.

2. If you have a CD-ROM of Windows 96, you can find this driver in the
   \drivers directory.
  
3. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the icon for
   the floppy disk drive that contains the file you downloaded,
   and then double-click the file itself. This extracts the driver.

4. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control 
   Panel.

5. Double-click the Mouse icon, click the General tab, and then click 
   Change. 

6. Click Browse, and then locate the file you extracted in step 3. 

7. Click OK in the Open dialog box and in the Install From Disk 
   dialog box.

NOTE: The drivers are available at no charge; however, standard
      connect-time fees and long-distance telephone charges, if 
      any, apply.


Logitech Mouse
==============

The Windows 96 Logitech driver supports Logitech MouseWare features. 
To use the middle button of a three-button Logitech Mouse, use the 
Logitech Mouse Control Center that came with your mouse.
 
If you are running Windows 96, do not run the Logitech MouseWare 
Setup program that was written for Windows 3.1. If you do, open Mouse 
properties, click the General tab, and then click Change. Then select 
the appropriate Windows 96 Logitech mouse type.  

If you use a Logitech serial mouse, but there is a PS/2 mouse port 
on your computer, Windows 96 may not correctly install the Logitech 
driver. If this occurs, use the Device Manager tab in System properties 
to change the PS/2 mouse item, if present, to "Logitech Serial Mouse."


Mouse Systems/Genius
====================

Windows 96 does not have built-in drivers for the Mouse Systems or 
Genius 3-button mouse. The standard mouse driver will work with these 
devices in their 2-button mode. Driver updates are available from 
the Windows Driver Library or in the \Drivers\Mouse folder on the 
Windows 96 CD-ROM.


Microsoft Natural Keyboards
===========================

Windows 96 has built-in support for your Microsoft Natural Keyboard. 
Windows logo keys have added functionality under the new operating 
system.

You will be unable to install IntelliType version 1.00 under Windows 96. 
If you upgrade to Windows 96 over a previously installed Windows 3.1 
configuration, IntelliType will have limited functionality.

If you are upgrading a Windows 3.1x configuration that has IntelliType 
version 1.00 software, it is recommended that you delete the following 
line from your System.ini file, which is located in the folder that 
contains your Windows 96 files:

	taskman.exe=TASKSW16.EXE

This will deactivate the Windows 3.1 IntelliType Task Manager and 
ensure full support of the Windows logo keys under Windows 96.  


Microsoft IntelliPoint 1.00
============================

Windows 96 has built-in support for your Microsoft mouse.

You will be unable to install IntelliPoint version 1.00 under 
Windows 96. If you upgrade to Windows 96 over a previously 
installed Windows 3.1 configuration, IntelliPoint will have 
limited functionality. Contact Microsoft for an updated version 
of IntelliPoint software.


Microsoft BallPoint Mouse
==========================

If you need to adjust settings for your BallPoint mouse such as 
orientation, use the Mouse Manager or IntelliPoint control panel 
icon that came with your mouse. If this control panel is not already 
installed on your computer, contact Microsoft for an updated version 
of the mouse software.

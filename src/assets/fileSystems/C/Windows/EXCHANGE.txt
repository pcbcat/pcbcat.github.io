WHAT IS WINDOWS MESSAGING? 
===========================

Windows Messaging enables you to send and receive e-mail, faxes, 
and documents in messages. Information services that can be used 
with Windows 96 include Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Fax, and the 
Microsoft Network. Also, a Microsoft Mail postoffice is included 
in this version of Windows 96. 


MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 
=============================

Windows Messaging runs on a minimum of 6 megabytes (MB) of RAM, 
and 10 MB of hard disk space (for the swapfile). However, it is 
recommended that you have at least 8 MB of RAM for good 
performance.


INSTALLATION
============

To install Windows Messaging during Windows 96 Setup, choose the 
information services that you would like to use with Windows 
Messaging.

You can also install Windows Messaging after you have completed 
installation of Windows 96 by double-clicking the Inbox icon 
on your desktop and then choosing the information services that 
you would like to use with Windows Messaging. 

If you have removed the Inbox from the desktop, you can install 
Windows Messaging by using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.  
You must shut down and restart Windows 96 after doing this. 

When you install Windows 96 or use Windows Messaging for the 
first time, the Windows Messaging Setup Wizard will be run. The 
Wizard is also run each time you add a new profile using the Mail 
And Fax icon in Control Panel. 


USING WINDOWS MESSAGING WITH MICROSOFT SCHEDULE+ 1.0
=====================================================

Windows Messaging is designed to work with Microsoft Schedule+ 
7.0. When Windows Messaging is installed, it will partially 
disable Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0. You will still be able to use 
Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 in standalone mode, but you will not be 
able to send or receive meeting requests. You will see an error 
message when starting Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 that notifies you 
that the mail spooler cannot be started. Click Yes to continue, 
and Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 will continue. 

Microsoft Schedule+ is disabled by changing Mailspl.exe to 
Mailspl.bak and by putting a StartupOffline=1 line into 
Schdplus.ini. 

NOTE:  There is no message warning you that these changes are 
made. 


USING WINDOWS MESSAGING WITH MICROSOFT MAIL
============================================

Windows Messaging is designed to replace the Microsoft Mail 
program that comes with Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft 
Mail version 3.x. After installing Windows Messaging you will 
no longer be able to run the older Microsoft Mail program, 
but you will be able to use Windows Messaging to send and 
receive messages. 


USING WINDOWS MESSAGING WITH THE COMPUSERVE SERVICE(SM)
========================================================

The setup program for the CompuServe Service(sm) for 
Windows Messaging is available on the Windows 96 CD in 
the \Drivers\Exchange\Compusrv directory.  The files will 
also be available on CompuServe in the "cissoft" forum. 
For more information, see the Cisnotes.rtf file in the 
\Drivers\Exchange\Compusrv directory of the Windows 96 CD.


UPGRADING A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION OF WINDOWS 96
===============================================

You can install Windows Messaging with Windows 96 over an 
existing Windows 96 setup. When you upgrade, you may lose some 
of your Windows Messaging preferences. 

There is NO interoperability between the final release and the 
beta releases. You cannot send or receive messages to or from 
mismatched Windows 96 releases. Upgrade all Windows Messaging 
users simultaneously to the released version of Windows Messaging. 



TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS 
====================

If you experience problems connecting to your Microsoft Mail 
postoffice, please ensure you have network access to your postoffice. 
You can also get diagnostic details about the reason for failures by 
clicking the Tools menu, clicking Microsoft Mail Tools, and then 
clicking View Session Log. 

If you experience a problem composing or reading a message that 
produces an error saying "Can't launch form," then the forms file 
may be corrupt. To correct this problem, quit Windows Messaging, 
and then go to your {Windows}\Forms directory and delete Frmcache.dat.  
From {Windows}\Forms, copy the file Frmcache.bak to Frmcache.dat, 
and restart Windows Messaging. 

Some Microsoft Mail 3.x extensions are not compatible with 
Windows Messaging--for example, WinRules and Conference+.  
Windows Messaging automatically disables some of these 
extensions to prevent system problems. If a Microsoft Mail 3.x 
extension is causing a problem, it can be disabled by placing a 
';' in front of the corresponding line in Msmail.ini.  Contact 
the product vendors for further information. 

If you experience a problem where messages are stuck in the Outbox, 
it is possible that the wrong information service is trying to process 
the message. To correct the problem, click the Tools menu, click 
Options, click Delivery, and then ensure the information services are 
listed in the order you want them. 

After quitting Windows Messaging, you may notice that mapisp32 is 
still running. Mapisp32 continues to run for 20 seconds after you 
quit Windows Messaging. 

E-forms created with the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer do not 
open correctly when saved in the .msg file format. Transfer the .msg 
file from the file system to the Inbox to open the e-form correctly.

If clicking Send on the File command in Lotus Approach does not 
work, please ensure that you have a file called Msmail.ini in your 
{Windows}\ directory.  If the file does not exist, just create an 
empty file with that name. 

Two clients using Microsoft Mail should not be run against the same 
Microsoft Mail mailbox. This configuration is not supported.

You cannot schedule faxes to be sent at a later time with this 
release of Windows 96.

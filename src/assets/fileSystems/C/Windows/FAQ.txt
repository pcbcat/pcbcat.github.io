[Q: What are some things I can do to make it easier to install 
    Windows 96?]

Some steps to follow to ensure a trouble-free installation are:
- Run a virus scan before running Setup.
- Run ScanDisk or Chkdsk before running Setup.
- Make sure you have at least 100 to110 MB of free disk space 
  (110 to 120 MB to back
  up your previous MS-DOS and Windows system files so you can 
  uninstall Windows 96 if needed).
- If you have had any problems with your hardware or software, 
  fix them before installing Windows 96.
- Turn off any screen savers or utilities that are running.
- Back up your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files to a floppy 
  disk.
- Remove any unnecessary programs from Config.sys and 
  Autoexec.bat. These may include Undelete programs, anti-virus 
  software, start-up configuration programs, or any disk utilities.
- Remark the LOAD= and RUN= lines in Win.ini by placing a 
  semicolon (;) in front of the LOAD and run lines--for example:

     ;load=C:\Msoffice\Msoffice.exe

- Shut down any anti-virus software you are running. If you 
  install Windows 96 on a computer that has a CMOS or system 
  BIOS-based anti-virus setting, you will receive an error 
  message and Setup will stop. Consult the hardware documentation 
  for information about system BIOS or CMOS-enabled settings such 
  as virus detection. 
- Run Setup from Windows or Windows for Workgroups.
- Shut down any running programs.
- Remove programs from the Startup group before installation.


[Q: How do I uninstall Windows 96?]

To return to a previously installed version of Windows 3.1, run 
the Uninstall program. To uninstall Windows 96, you must have 
chosen "Save System Files" during Setup. 

To run the uninstall program:

** If Windows 96 is running:
1. Click the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click 
   Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon, and then click 
  the Install/Uninstall tab.
3. In the list of software that can be removed by Windows, 
  click Windows 96.
4. Click Add/Remove, and then follow the directions on your 
   screen. 

   The Uninstall program removes all long filename entries 
   from your hard disk, and then runs an MS-DOS-based program 
   to remove Windows 96 and restore your previous MS-DOS and 
   Windows 3.x files.

** If Windows 96 is not running:
1. Start your computer  from the Windows 96 Emergency Repair 
   Disk if you created one during setup.
2. Type UNINSTAL at the A prompt. 

OR

1. Start your computer from an MS-DOS boot disk.
2. Type the following at the A prompt:

     X:\Windows\Command\Uninstall.exe

     Where x is the drive letter where Windows 96 is installed, 
     and \Windows is the name of your Windows 96 directory.

NOTES:

* It is recommended that you run Uninstall from within Windows 96;
  otherwise, all long filename information may not be completely
  removed from your hard disk.

* If Windows 96 came preinstalled on your computer, there is no
  uninstall option.


[Q: How do I install Windows 96 from a CD-ROM drive?]

Windows 96 can be installed from a CD-ROM drive from within MS-DOS 
or from within an existing version of Windows. The preferred and 
most reliable method is to install it from an existing version of 
Windows. 

To install Windows 96 from MS-DOS: 
1. Insert the Windows 96 CD in the CD-ROM drive. 
2. At the C:\ prompt, type the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive 
   followed by a colon (:) and a backslash (\), and the word Setup. 
   For example: 

     D:\Setup

3. Press ENTER, and then follow the instructions on your screen.
4. Click Next to continue Setup, and then follow the instructions 
   on your screen.

To install from your current version of Windows: 
1. Start Windows, and then insert the Windows 96 CD in the 
   appropriate drive.
2. In File Manager or Program Manager, click the File menu, and 
   then click Run.
3. Type:

     x:\Setup

   where x is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.
4. Follow the instructions on your screen.
5. Click Next to continue Setup.


[Q: How do I install Windows 96 from a remote CD-ROM drive?]

If the computer with the CD-ROM drive is running Windows for 
Workgroups or Windows 96, share the CD-ROM drive, and then follow 
these steps:

1. Connect to the shared CD-ROM by connecting to a network drive 
   in File Manager or by typing the NET USE command at the command 
   prompt. For example:

     net use * \\machine\cdshare

2. Double-click Setup.exe, or at the command prompt type Setup.


[Q: How do I prepare my computer for a clean installation of 
    Windows 96?]

Windows 96 will install over MS-DOS, as well as over existing 
versions of Windows and Windows for Workgroups.

From File Manager in Windows or Windows for Workgroups:

1. Click the drive letter for the drive that Windows 96 will be 
   installed from. For example:

     a:\ (floppy disk users)
     d:\ (CD-ROM users)

2. Double-click Setup.exe to start the installation process.

During installation, Windows 96 checks for available disk space.
If the required hard-disk space is not available, Windows 96 
displays how much free space is available and how much is 
required. To free up space on the hard disk, remove unnecessary 
files.


[Q: Do I need to reinstall my programs when I install Windows 96?]

Windows 96 will pick up program settings when you upgrade an 
existing version of Windows or Windows for Workgroups. If 
Windows 96 is installed in a separate directory, all Windows-based 
programs need to be reinstalled.


[Q: How do I set up Windows 96 on a computer running Windows NT?]

The Windows NT computer must be configured to multi-boot between 
Windows NT and MS-DOS. 

1. Start the Windows NT computer in MS-DOS mode.
2. Run Windows 3.x, and then in Program Manager, select the File 
   menu, and then choose the Run command.
3. Type:

     x:\Setup.exe

     where x is the drive letter containing your Windows 96 
     Setup disk or CD-ROM.
4. Install Windows 96 in a new directory. 

NOTES:
* Windows 96 cannot be installed into the same directory as
  Windows NT or into a shared Windows NT/Windows 3.x directory. 

* A FAT16 partition is required for the Windows 96 / Windows NT
  dual-boot configuration to work. Windows 96 must be installed
  into a separate directory on the FAT partition. The Windows NT
  OS Loader automatically provides a choice for Windows 96 or
  MS-DOS on the menu.

* Windows 96 cannot access data stored in NTFS partitions and,
  Windows NT cannot access data stored in FAT32 partitions.


[Q: I have 25 MB free on my hard disk, and when I try to upgrade 
    to Windows 96 it tells me I do not have enough disk space. 
    How much do I need for Windows 96 if I am upgrading?]

When you upgrade over Windows 96, you need 90 to 100 MB of free 
disk space, as opposed to 100 to 110 MB for a full installation.

NOTE: Actual numbers vary depending on the options and accessories 
you select during Setup. If you use disk compression (MS-DOS 
DoubleSpace or DriveSpace, or Stacker), Setup may require more 
than 90 to 100 MB because of the way disk compression estimates 
available space. Setup adjusts the required free space to ensure 
that you do not run out of disk space during Setup. 


[Q: Can I install Windows 96 on a computer that has 
    OS/2\MS-DOS\Windows? Can I still dual boot?]

Windows 96 Setup.exe will not run on OS/2. To install Windows 96,
start the computer in MS-DOS mode, and then run Setup.exe from 
the MS-DOS prompt.

NOTE: If you are upgrading over OS/2 on an HPFS partition, you 
will need your OS/2 disk 1 during Setup.

If you are using OS/2 Boot Manager to choose operating systems 
at startup, Setup will disable Boot Manager to ensure that 
Windows 96 can restart the computer and complete its installation. 
You can reactivate Boot Manager by running the FDISK utility that 
comes with Windows 96 (see procedure at the end of this section).

If you are not using Boot Manager, configure your computer to use 
Boot Manager, and then follow the instructions above. Consult your 
OS/2 documentation for information about Boot Manager.

If you start MS-DOS from a floppy disk and then run Setup, you will 
not be able to start OS/2 after Windows 96 is installed. You need 
to delete the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files that OS/2 uses 
before running Setup.

To remove OS/2 from your computer after you install Windows 96:
1. Back up the files you want to keep onto a floppy disk or 
   network drive.
2. Delete the files in each of your OS/2 directories and 
   subdirectories, and then delete the OS/2 directories.
3. In the root directory, delete the following hidden files:

    EA DATA.SF
    OS2LDR.MSG
    OS2KRNL
    OS2BOOT
    WP DATA.SF

To make sure hidden files are visible, in My Computer or Windows 
Explorer, click the View menu, click Options, and then click Show 
All Files. Then delete the OS/2 files listed above.

NOTE: If you have a version of OS/2 other than version 2.0, the 
names of your OS/2 files may differ from those in this procedure. 
Also, depending on which version of OS/2 you have, you may see 
the following files in your root directory. You can also delete 
these files:

    OS2DUMP
    OS2LDR
    OS2LOGO
    OS2VER

4. Empty the Recycle Bin to permanently remove the files from 
   your computer. 
5. If you had Boot Manager installed and want to remove it, 
   restart your computer and then complete the following steps. 
   (It is recommended that you print this file before restarting 
   your computer.)
6. When you see the Boot Manager menu, choose to restart your 
   computer in MS-DOS mode, and then run FDisk.
7. Make the MS-DOS partition (C) your active partition.
8. Quit Fdisk, and then restart your computer.

To reinstall Boot Manager after you install Windows 96:
1. From the Windows 96 Start menu, click Run ,and then type 
   FDISK.
2. Choose Set Active Partition.
3. Enter the number of the Boot Manager Partition. This partition 
   is the 1MB Non-MS-DOS partition usually placed at the top or 
   bottom.
4. Quit FDISK, and then restart your computer as instructed. You 
   can now start OS/2 at any time and change labels of partitions 
   in Boot Manager through the OS/2 FDISK program.

NOTE: OS/2 cannot access data stored in FAT32 partitions.

[Q: How do I make copies of my original disks to install from?]

The DMF disk format is not compatible with the DISKCOPY or COPY 
commands and increases the amount of data stored on a standard 
1.44/3.5" disk. There is no way to make a direct copy of these 
disks.


[Q: Can I make floppy disk images from the CD?]

The CD-ROM contains cabinet files (*.cab) files that are 2 MB 
each and cannot be copied onto floppy disks. 


[Q: Setup stops responding while it is gathering information. 
    How can I bypass the problem?]

Occasionally, Setup stops while detecting a device on the computer. 
To work around this:

1. Turn the computer off for 10 seconds, and then turn it back on.
2. Rerun Setup, and then choose Safe Recovery to bypass the problem 
   area.
3. Setup continues, bypassing the detection problem it encountered 
   on the previous attempt.
4. If this happens again, repeat steps 1 through 3 until Windows 96 
   setup process is compete. 

NOTE: If you have already run Safe Recovery several times, another 
option is to manually specify the hardware on your computer to 
minimize the chance of Setup stopping, since Setup will detect 
only the hardware you specify.


[Q: Should I set up a separate partition to install Windows 96?]

As with any software package, it is always a good idea to have 
a backup before installing it. Windows 96 has been tested on 
thousands of computers on many system configurations with a 
very high success rate, so we are confident that you will have 
few, if any, problems installing Windows 96.

You can enable an uninstall feature during Setup. Uninstall copies 
your previous MS-DOS and Windows 3.x versions and keeps a log, so 
that Windows 96 can be removed and the previous files returned to 
where they were before Windows 96 was installed.

Windows 96 does not require its own partition; however, it can 
be installed if you want to dual boot between your current 
Windows 3.x installation and Windows 96.

NOTES:

* Windows 96 version 4.00.960B does not support dual booting 
  to a previous MS-DOS/Windows 3.x installation. To check the 
  Windows 96 version number, right-click the My Computer icon 
  on your desktop, click Properties, and then click the General 
  tab.

* If you received Windows 96 preinstalled on your computer, the
  uninstall feature is not available.

[Q: Should I install into my existing Windows directory or a 
    different directory?]

Preserving your existing installation of Windows and upgrading 
on top of it is highly recommended as Setup is using your existing 
configuration files (Config.sys, Autoexec.bat, System.ini, Win.ini, 
Protocol.ini) for more accurate detection and installation. The 
advantage to installing in your existing Windows directory is that 
the previous settings and applications are used in the new 
installation. 

The advantage to installing Windows 96 into a different directory 
is that it preserves your previous DOS/Windows configuration, 
allowing you to dual boot between versions. The disadvantage is 
that all Windows applications and possibly drivers for hardware 
peripherals (sound cards, tape drives, etc.) must be re-installed 
to put the proper support files in place as well as the application 
settings in the .ini files and/or the registry.

NOTE: Windows 96 version 4.00.960B does not support dual booting 
to a previous MS-DOS/Windows 3.x installation. To check the 
Windows 96 version number, right-click the My Computer icon on 
your desktop, click Properties, and then click the General tab.


[Q: How do I set up Windows 96 into a separate subdirectory?]

During Setup, Windows 96 you are prompted to provide a directory 
to install Windows 96 into. 

To install Windows 96 into a new directory:
1. Click the Other Directory option, and then click Next.
2. Enter the new directory. For example, C:\Win96.


[Q: What files do I backup to preserve Windows 96 settings?]

You can use the Windows 96 Backup utility to backup your system 
and all user and software specific preferences. In order to do 
this, use the Full System Backup File set which is described on 
the second screen that comes up when you run Backup.

NOTE: After installing Windows 96 into another directory, all 
programs (and possibly all hardware-peripheral drivers) must be 
re-installed.


[Q: I have installed Windows 96 into different directory than 
    Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3.1x. How do I set up 
    to dual boot between them?]

When installing Windows 96 into a different directory, dual 
booting is enabled by default. Dual boot is available only if 
the existing version of MS-DOS is version 5.0 or greater. If 
you are using version 5.0 or greater, you can set up dual-
booting as follows:

1. Start your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 96" 
   prompt, press F8.
2. From the menu, select Previous Version Of MS-DOS.

NOTE: Windows 96 version 4.00.960B does not support this method 
of dual booting to a previous version of MS-DOS. To check the 
Windows 96 version number, right-click the My Computer icon on 
your desktop, click Properties, and then click the General tab.


[Q: What files does Windows 96 modify during Setup?]

Windows 96 is a new operating system, and affects many files on 
the system.


[Q: Can I run the Windows 96 Setup program from MS-DOS? Do I lose 
    any functionality?]

If you have a running installation of Windows 3.x or Windows for 
Workgroups 3.x1, it is strongly recommended that you run Setup 
from your existing version of Windows. This provides the safest 
and smoothest installation. If you do run Setup from MS-DOS, and 
it detects Windows on the computer, it will recommend quitting 
Setup and rerunning it from Windows. If you do run Setup from 
MS-DOS, Setup may run slower (especially if you are installing 
from floppy disks). 


[Q: Can I set up Windows 96 from a network?]

Yes. There are two ways to set up Windows 96 from a network 
location:

- Create a Windows 96 flat directory either by using the COPY 
  command for a CD-ROM, or by using the EXTRACT command for 
  floppy disks. Connect to the shared directory, run Setup, and 
  then choose a directory on your computer to set up to. 
- Go to the Nettools directory (CD-ROM only) to use the Netsetup 
  Utility.


[Q: Setup stops after the first reboot. Why won't it restart?]

There could be several reasons, ranging from video problems to 
disk-access issues. Here are some steps to troubleshoot a no-start 
situation:
  
1. Restart Windows 96, and then press F8 when you see the message 
   "Starting Windows 96...". 
2. Choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu. If Windows 96 starts, 
   change the video driver to the standard VGA driver by following 
   these steps:

   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click 
      Control Panel.
   2. Double-click the Display icon.
   3. Click the Settings tab, and then click Change Display Type.
   4. Click Change in the Adapter Type section, and then click 
      Show Compatible Devices.
   5. Click Standard Display Types, and then double-click Standard 
      Display Adapter (VGA). Click OK.
   6. Restart Windows 96.

If Windows 96 still stops during startup:

1. Rename Config.sys and Autoexec.bat and/or
2. Go to Control Panel, and then double-click the System icon.
3. Click the Performance tab, and then click the File System 
   button.
4. Select the Troubleshooting tab.
5. Check all of the available boxes, and then click OK in all 
   dialog boxes and reboot.


[Q: I was running Setup for the first time and it stopped during 
    hardware detection. What do I do now?]

If your computer stops during the hardware-detection phase of 
Setup, turn off the power on your system, wait 10 seconds, and then 
turn the power back on. Do not press CTRL-ALT-DEL. When your system 
restarts, restart Windows using Safe Recovery, which will skip the 
portion of detection that caused the problem. If your system stops 
again, it will be in a different detection module. Perform these 
steps as many times as necessary to allow your system to complete 
detection.


[Q: Setup didn't detect my network card, how do I set up my network 
    card?]

To add a network adapter: 
From Control Panel, double click Add New Hardware, and let Windows
try to detect the network card. If it does not, you can manually 
select it as follows:
	
1. From Control Panel, double click the Network icon.
2. Click Add, and then click Adapter. 
3. Find your make and model from the list of manufacturers. 
4. Change the displayed settings to match your card's 
   configuration.

   - If it is not a listed network adapter, check the disk that 
     came with your adapter. If the driver came with Windows or 
     Lanman (NDIS compatible) disks, then select "Have Disk" 
     and point it to the path of the Oemsetup.inf file. 
   - If there are only Novell ODI drivers available, install the 
     driver in Autoexec.bat using the LSL.com and the <nic_odi>.com 
     (provided by Novell and the NetWare card manufacturer) and 
     then select "Existing ODI Driver" from "(detected net drivers)." 

   For more information on how to install the ODI driver, consult 
   your network card manufacturer.


[Q: I am installing Windows 96 from CD-ROM, and the system hangs on 
    the first boot. Why?]

The most likely reason is that there may be a real-mode and 
protected-mode conflict with the CD-ROM driver, and Setup is unable 
to continue. Try remarking out the CD-ROM drivers in Config.sys. If 
this doesn't solve the problem, then try these troubleshooting 
procedures:

*Can you boot into Windows in Safe mode? If not, reinstall.

If you can: 
- Create a Bootlog.txt file to see where it failed.
- Look for the Detcrash.log file. If it is present, the problem 
  is with
  hardware detection.
- Check Ios.ini and remark out the drivers that are loading in 
  Config.sys in case there is a problem with these protect-mode 
  drivers.
- Check device manager for any conflicts. Don't be afraid to remove 
  any device from here if you suspect it is the troublemaker.
- Change the display driver to standard VGA.
- Try the step-by-step boot. 
- Rename Autoexec.bat and Config.sys so they don't load on the next 
  boot.

Copy System.cb to System.ini; very few drivers load here (not even 
the mouse). If this solves the problem, check your System.ini for 
any entries made by any third party applications; for example, Adobe 
Type Manager.


[Q: How do I install Microsoft Fax?]

To install Microsoft Fax during Setup, when the Accessories screen 
is displayed, make sure Microsoft Fax is checked. If you have not selected
Windows Messaging, you will see a prompt to select it as well.

To install Microsoft Fax after Setup, go to Control Panel, double-
click the Add/Remove Programs icon, and then click the Windows Setup 
tab. In the Accessories box, scroll to Microsoft Fax, and make sure it is 
checked. If you have not selected Windows Messaging, you will see a prompt 
to select it also.

NOTE: Windows Messaging and Microsoft Fax require at least 10 MB of free space to 
install.


[Q: After running Setup I can no longer access my CD-ROM, why?]

If your CD-ROM is proprietary, (Sony, Mitsumi, and Panasonic), 
Windows 96 will install the drivers. If the CD-ROM is not detected, 
there is a conflict with the device or the controller, and you 
should check the settings for conflicts in the Device Manager in 
Control Panel. Add new devices by double-clicking the Install New 
Hardware icon in Control Panel.


[Q: I am having a problem with the refresh rate of my monitor. How 
    do I fix it?]

To adjust the refresh rate in Windows 96, click the Start button,
click Settings, and then click Control Panel. Double-click the 
Display icon, click the Settings tab, and then click the Advanced 
Properties button. Click the Adapter tab, and then select the 
refresh rate from the list.

To adjust the refresh rate in MS-DOS mode, you must specify your 
monitor type in an adapter setup program supplied by your display 
adapter or PC manufacturer. Some utilities must be run in Autoexe.bat. 
On some PCs, monitor type is set in BIOS configuration programs. 
Examples of utilities from adapter manufacturers include:

     ATI                      INSTALL.EXE
     Cirrus Logic             MONTYPE.EXE, CLMODE.EXE, WINMODE.EXE
     Diamond Stealth          STLMODE.EXE
     Diamond Stealth 64       S64MODE.EXE
     Matrox                   \MGA\SETUP\SETUP.EXE
     Tseng Labs               VMODE.EXE
     Western Digital          VGAMODE.EXE

[Q: How do I boot to an MS-DOS prompt ( C:\> )?]

You can find this information in Windows Help Index. Look up
"Restarting your computer, in MS-DOS mode."


[Q: How do I boot to my previous version of DOS?]

Windows 96 version 4.00.960 B does not support dual booting 
to a previous MS-DOS/Windows 3.x installation. To check the 
Windows 96 version number, right-click the My Computer icon on 
your desktop, click Properties, and then click the General tab.


[Q: Will I be able to multiboot PC-DOS 7.0?]

No, for the same reason as listed above.


=================
Disk Compression
=================

[Q: Will Windows 96 work if I have compressed my hard drive using 
    Stac Electronics Stacker software?]

Yes, Windows 96 is fully compatible with Stacker versions 2.x and 
greater, as well as all versions of Superstore. Older compression 
drivers from third-party disk compression utilities function in 
real-mode only. For upgraded Windows 96 drivers, contact your 
software compression vendor.

Windows 96 supplies a built-in disk compression utility called 
DriveSpace that runs in protected mode. The advantages of DriveSpace 
are that compression is faster, and it is built into the operating
system. See Windows 96 Help for more information on DriveSpace.


=============================
Using CD-ROMs with Windows 96
=============================

[Q: Windows 96 does not detect my CD-ROM. Why is this? How do I get 
    my CD-ROM to work?]

CD-ROMs may be SCSI, proprietary, or IDE controller based.

Windows 96 only detects proprietary controller-based CD-ROMS 
(specifically Panasonic, Mitsumi, and Sony brands). Windows 96 also 
detects the SCSI controllers; however, drivers for the SCSI bus will 
enumerate the CD-ROMs. 

1. Open Control Panel, and then double-click the System icon.
2. Select the Device Manager tab.
3. Verify that a SCSI or IDE controller exists in the device tree.
   (If the SCSI or IDE controller branch is not available look up
   "Adding, Hardware" in the Help Index.)
4. Open the branch for SCSI or IDE controller by clicking the 
   plus (+) sign.
5. Click the controller, and then click Properties.
6. In the General Tab, verify that the Device Status message states 
   "This device is working properly" and that the Device Usage 
   checkbox is enabled for "Current Configuration"
7. Click the Resources tab, and then verify that the "Conflicting 
   Device List" displays "No Conflicts."
   - If a conflict exists, the conflicting devices are listed. 
   - Verify that the Resource Settings match the actual hardware 
     settings of the controller. Refer to the SCSI or IDE controller 
     documentation.
8. If multiple devices are connected to a SCSI or IDE controller, 
   and any of the SCSI or IDE devices are not supported by Windows 96 
   with a protected mode driver, then access to all devices connected 
   to the controller will be provided via manufacturer-supplied MS-DOS 
   drivers only. Contact the device manufacturer for information on 
   protected-mode Windows 96 drivers.

[Q: How do I set up my Windows 96 computer for a TCP/IP network?]

First, find out from your system administrator if your network is 
using a DHCP server to allocate IP addresses automatically, or if 
you have been assigned a specific IP address. Once you have this 
information, follow these steps:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.
2. On the Configuration tab, click Add, and then double-click 
   Protocol.
3. Click Microsoft, and then click TCP/IP.
 
After it is installed, click TCP/IP on the Configuration tab of 
Network properties, and then click Properties. Configure your 
protocol per instructions from your system administrator.


[Q: How do I set up Netware support?]

There are three ways to access a Novell network with Windows 96. 
If you are using Novell Netware 3.x, or if you have bindery 
services enabled with 4.x, you can use the Microsoft Client for 
Netware. This is installed from the Network properties by clicking 
Add, clicking Client, clicking Microsoft, and then clicking 
Microsoft Client for Netware. 

If you need to load real-mode TSRs from your login script, you 
must use the real-mode shell NETX or VLM, available from Novell. 
If you are using NDS services with 4.x, you must install the VLM 
client. 

If you are using NETX, you need to install the Novell Workstation 
Shell 3.x from Network properties. Click Add, click Client, and 
then click the Novell properties dialog box. If you are using the 
VLM client, install the Novell Workstation Shell 4.x client. 

NOTE: You must have the proper version of the Windows support 
files from Novell to use either Workstation Shell option.


[Q: I am running a non-Microsoft network, and I can't connect to 
    my network resources, why?]

If it is a real-mode network, the network client must be loaded 
from Autoexec.bat and/or Config.sys before Windows 96 loads. If 
it is a network that Windows 96 does not recognize, then all drive 
mappings and resource connections may need to be done before 
starting Windows 96. Resource mappings done in an MS-DOS prompt 
may only be accessible while that MS-DOS prompt is running. If it 
is a supported network, make sure the client support is installed 
in Network Properties.

[Q: Why do the applications from my Novell server give an 
    "Incorrect MS-DOS version" message?] 

There are two possible reasons. Novell Netware login scripts can 
use a Netware login script variable, OSVersion, to track which 
versions of MS-DOS the clients are running and to map a drive to 
a directory on the Novell server that contains a copy of that 
version of MS-DOS. Your network administrator needs to ensure 
that the same has been done for Windows 96, which will report 
MS-DOS version 7.1. You should also check the SETVER table, and 
see what version is being reported for the particular programs. 
You may need to modify the table to have the correct version 
reported to the system.


[Q:How do I set up Windows 96 with Lantastic 6.0?]

To configure Windows 96 to support an Artisoft LANtastic network,
contact the vendor and request a Windows 96 LANtastic *.inf.

NOTE: You cannot use Network Neighborhood to view LANtastic 
resources. You must use the LANtastic utilities in the LANtastic 
program group.


[Q: How do I install a PPP dial-up network connection?]

You will need a modem installed and configured correctly. If the 
Dial-up Networking option is not installed, add it by opening 
Control Panel and then double-clicking Add/Remove Programs. Click 
the Windows Setup tab, and then follow the instructions on your 
screen.

Once installed, open the Dial-up Networking folder in My Computer. 
Start the connection wizard. The PPP protocol is installed by 
default because it is the most flexible, being able to work over 
NetBeui, IPX/SPX and TCP/IP.


[Q: How do I set up Dial-Up Networking to connect to a Novell 
    server?]

Install the following components from the Network icon in 
Control Panel:

- Microsoft Client for Netware Networks
- IPX/SPX compatible protocol bound to the Microsoft Dial-up 
  Adapter driver.
	
To use Dial-up Networking to connect to a Netware Connect Server, 
you must specify Netware Connect as the server type in a Dial-up 
Networking connection's properties. 


[Q: Why does my system stop at the login script?]

If the connection to the server is lost, the login script processor 
for NetWare may appear to stop, the Microsoft Client for NetWare 
will timeout, and an error will appear. Contact your network 
administrator if you experience problems with the network and the 
login script.

[Q: How do I configure my computer to answer Dial Up Networking 
    calls?]

If you have Microsoft Plus! you can configure your computer to 
answer Dial-Up Networking calls. 

1. Start running Dial-Up Networking.
2. On the Connections menu, click Dial-Up Server.
3. Click Allow caller access.

If you do not have Microsoft Plus!, you can only use Dial-Up 
Networking to call out from your computer, not receive Dial-Up 
Networking calls.

[Q: What socket services do I need to use with my PCMCIA network 
    adapter?]

To use a protected mode PCMCIA network card, your socket services 
must match your network card. If you use a real mode network card 
driver, you must use real mode socket services. If you use a 
protected mode net card driver, you must use protected mode socket 
services. To determine what kind of network card driver you're using, 
go to the Driver Type properties for your network adapter, in the 
Network Control Panel. Choose a driver type. To enable protected 
mode socket services, run the PCMCIA wizard from Control Panel.

[Q: How do I get my PCMCIA cards to work in protected mode?]

Double click the PCMCIA wizard and then follow the instructions 
on the screen. You may be asked to select your PCMCIA network or 
SCSI card during this process. After the wizard runs, you will no 
longer be loading the device drivers in your configuration files, 
and you will be running with protected mode drivers from within 
Windows 96.

[Q: Setup didn't detect my modem, how do I install it?]

To install a modem in Windows 96, go to Control Panel, and double-
click the Modem icon. Start the Modem installation wizard which 
will guide you through the installation of your modem.

NOTE: This procedure is for internal or external modems. PCMCIA 
modems automatically install when inserted (requires protected mode 
PCMCIA drivers).


[Q: My modem won't dial or connect. Why?]

NOTE: There is a troubleshooter for modem problems in Windows 
Help.

If your modem is not set up correctly, communications features 
may not function properly. The following procedures list steps 
to verify the correct operation of your modem and Windows 96 
communications.

Because some communications programs designed for Windows 3.1 
install incompatible driver files, which may cause COM ports and 
modems to stop working, first verify that the correct Windows 96 
files are being loaded.

To verify that the required communications files are present:
1. Verify the files sizes and dates of COMM.DRV and SERIAL.VXD 
   in the System directory against the original versions from 
   the Windows 96 floppy disks or CD-ROM.
2. Confirm that the following lines are present in System.ini:
     [boot]
     Comm.drv=Comm.drv
     [386enh]
     device=*vcd
3. To revert to the default communications drivers for Windows 96, 
   select communications port entries in Device Manager.
4. Run the Add New Hardware wizard in Control Panel to detect and
   install the Windows 96 drivers.

NOTE: Windows 96 does not load the SERIAL.VXD driver in System.ini. 
Rather, Windows 96 loads it on demand using the registry. Also, 
there is no corresponding file for the *vcd entry in System.ini. 
This is an internal file built into VMM32.VXD.

To verify the modem configuration
1. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.
2. Verify that the manufacturer and model for your modem is correct. 
   If not, run the Install New Modem wizard to detect the modem and 
   confirm it with the current registry configuration.
3. If your current modem does not appear in the list of installed 
   modems, click Add, and then select the appropriate modem.
4. If the manufacturer and model are not correct and are not 
   available from the list, try the Hayes-compatible option for 
   Generic Modem driver, set to the maximum baud rate supported 
   by the modem, and then click OK.

   Remove any other modem entries in the list of eliminate 
   conflicts.

To verify the modem is enabled 
1. Double-click the System icon in Control Panel, and then click 
   the Device Manager tab.
2. Select your modem from the list and click Properties.
3. Make sure the option, The Device Is Present, Please Use It, is 
   checked.

To verify that the port is correct
1. Double-click the Modems icon in the Control Panel.
2. Select your modem, and then click Properties.
3. On the General tab, verify that the listed port is correct. If 
   it is not, select the correct port, and then click OK.

To determine if a serial port I/O address and IRQ settings are 
properly defined
1. Double-click the System icon in the Control Panel.
2. Click the Device Manager tab, and then click Ports.
3. Select a specific port, and click the Properties button.
4. Click the Resources tab to display the current resource settings 
   for that port. To find out the correct settings, consult the 
   modem manual.
5. In the Resources dialog box, check the Conflicting Devices List 
   to see if the modem is using resources in conflict with other 
   devices.
6. If the modem is in conflict with other devices, click Change 
   Settings, and then click a configuration that does not have 
   resource conflicts.

NOTE: Do not try to use a modem on COM3 if there is a serial mouse 
or other device on COM1. Usually, COM1 and COM3 ports use the same 
IRQ and cannot be used simultaneously on most computers. The COM2 
and COM4 ports have the same problem. If possible, change the COM3 
and COM4 port to an IRQ setting that is not in conflict. Also, some 
display adapters have an address conflict with COM4 ports. To work 
around this conflict, use another COM port; or, replace your graphics 
adapters.

To check the port settings
1. Double-click the Modems icon in Control Panel, click a modem, and 
   then click Properties.
2. Click the Connection tab to check the current port settings, such 
   as baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity. 
3. Click Advanced to check error control and flow control. If you are 
   using Win 16-based programs, turn off these advanced features.
3. Verify the UART type.

Data transmission problems may occur when a baud rate greater than 
9600 is selected on a slower 8036-based computer not equipped with 
a 16550 UART, or when performing other tasks during a file download. 
If problems or errors occur during transmission, try lowering the 
baud rate. Attempting to use baud rates greater than 9600 on 
computers equipped with 8250 or 16450 UARTs will probably result 
in dropped characters.

To check modem baud rate
1. Double-click the Modems icon in Control Panel.
2. Select the modem, and then click Properties.
3. Click the General tab, and then set the baud rate to the correct 
   speed. Lower speeds may work, especially when using an older 
   computer.
5. Click Only Connect At This Speed if it is not already selected.

NOTE: If the host system you are calling cannot communicate at the 
initial baud rate, it may or may not be able to negotiate a slower 
baud rate.

Tip: To optimize communications performance, you can set the baud 
rate higher if your computer has an 80486 or a Pentium(TM) processor.

To disable hardware flow control if your modem cable doesn't support 
it:
1. Double-click the Modems icon in Control Panel.
2. Click a modem, and then click Properties.
3. Click the Connections tab, and then click Advanced.
4. Make sure the option Use Flow Control is unchecked.

[Q: Why can't I see my hard disk when I start my computer from a floppy 
    disk?]

If your hard disk is a FAT32 partition and your start-up floppy disk is 
not from Windows 96 version 4.00.960 B, it will not recognize the FAT32 
drive. Update the system files on the start-up floppy disk with the 
Windows 96 4.00.960 B SYS command. To do this, type the following at

[Q: Is NTFS supported by Windows 96?]

NTFS is not directly supported under Windows 96. NTFS volumes can 
only be accessed by Windows NT locally. If Windows 96 is installed 
on a computer already running Windows NT with an NTFS volume, it 
will not be able to access any information that volume contains. 
Windows 96 can access NTFS volumes across a network connection.

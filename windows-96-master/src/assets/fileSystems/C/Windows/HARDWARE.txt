=============

PCI Systems
-----------
If the video is configured by the BIOS to consume an IRQ and you need 
to use the secondary PCI IDE controller in your PC, your video will work 
only in VGA mode. To load the accelerated Windows 96 driver for your video, 
disable the secondary PCI IDE controller in the BIOS and the Device Manager 
(located in the System control panel). Another alternative (if supported 
by the BIOS) is to disable the IRQ of the video device. 

IBM Thinkpad Models 750 (all 750 series except 750ce)
-----------------------------------------------------
A new BIOS that solves several problems with power management is
available from IBM's bulletin board. Download the latest System Program 
Service Diskette for the Thinkpad 750 from the BBS. See your hardware
documentation for information on how to access the IBM bulletin board.

IBM Thinkpad Models 755cd, cx, ce, cse, cdv (but not 755c)
----------------------------------------------------------
We are in the process of resolving with IBM several known problems:
1. Mwave is lost if you have more than 8 MB of memory.
   - IBM is working on updated drivers. The 1.1 revision does not
     solve this problem.
2. If you install Windows 96 into the same directory that contains 
   your current version of Windows, Mwave will continue to function. 
   - If you install Windows 96 to a different directory, Mwave will 
     not work unless you reinstall the Mwave drivers by using IBM's 
     Mwave setup program disks. This is by design. The Windows 3.1 
     drivers are required to run the Mwave chip.
3. The infrared port shows up with problems in Device Manager.
   - IBM is working on an updated Infrared VxD that resolves this
     problem.
4. Docking is not supported.
   - IBM is expected to release fixes to their Plug and Play BIOS 
     shortly, which will enable full Windows 96 Plug and Play and 
     docking support. For updates to the System Program Service 
     Diskette for your model of Thinkpad, check IBM's bulletin 
     board. See your hardware documentation for information about
     accessing the bulletin board.
5. There are power management problems with the suspend and resume
   commands.
   - If you have a 1994 BIOS, you can usually resolve these problems
     by upgrading to the latest Flash BIOS revision from 1996. You can
     find it on CompuServe, THINKPAD forum, or on IBM's bulletin board.
     See your IBM hardware documentation for information about accessing
     the bulletin board.
6. Mwave versions earlier than 1.2 contain numerous bugs.
   - These bugs in earlier versions of Mwave cause serious problems when 
     Mwave is run on Windows 96. For more information, call the IBM PC 
     HelpCenter.  

IBM Thinkpad Dock II
--------------------
If you use IBM Thinkpad Dock II, you must disable the BIOS for the
Adaptec 1530P SCSI controller in the docking station before starting
your computer while it is docked. If you do not, your computer will
hang repeatedly. This controller works fine in protected mode even
without the BIOS enabled, so you should not lose access to any SCSI
devices as a result.

To disable the BIOS:
1. Restart your computer while it is docked.
2. Press CTRL+A to start the Adaptec SCSISelect utility.
3. Choose Configure/View Host Adapter Settings.
4. Choose Advanced Configuration Options.
5. Change the setting for Host Adapter BIOS to Disabled.

Press ESC until you are prompted to exit the utility, at which point
the computer will restart.

An even better solution is to disable the BIOS completely, which will
enable the adapter to run completely in Plug and Play mode. This will
allow its resources to be allocated dynamically at Windows 96 startup.
However, this requires changing a DIP switch inside the dock unit.
For details about disabling the SCSI adapter BIOS, refer to your Dock II
manual.

Micron M5-PI Series
-------------------
Before installing Windows, users of Micron M5-PI series (P-60, P-66) 
need to be sure the BIOS read/write jumper(W22) is set to the read-only 
position. If you try to install Windows 96 with this jumper in the
read\write position, it may cause BIOS corruption. For more information,
contact Micron Technologies.

Micron P90/100
---------------
Before installing Windows, users of Micron P90 and P100 systems must 
make sure their BIOS version is N15 or later. For more information, 
contact Micron Technologies.

NEC Versa M and AT&T Globalyst
------------------------------
If you use AT&T Globalyst and NEC Versa M, you must set the BIOS
setting for PCMCIA Power to Enabled before running the PC Card (PCMCIA)
wizard to enable the Windows 96 PCMCIA support. The default setting is
Disabled. 

To change the PCMCIA Power setting to Enabled:
1. Restart your computer.
2. When the cursor changes to a rectangle, press F1.
3. When the BIOS configuration program is ready, select Power, and
   then change the PCMCIA Power setting to Enabled.
4. Save these settings.

Winbook XP
----------
There is a problem on the Winbook XP which could cause the keyboard
not to function properly. The workaround is to disable Windows 96
power status polling.

To disable Windows 96 power status polling:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon, and then click the
   Device Manager tab.
2. Click the plus (+) sign next to the system class you want to change.
3. Double click Advanced Power Management Support, and then click the
   Settings tab.
4. Make sure that the Disable Power Status Polling box is checked.
5. Click OK to save your changes and exit Control Panel.

HP OmniBook 600C
----------------
The Omnibook's PCMCIA controller is supported via special drivers 
in the Drivers directory on the CD version of Windows 96, or via the 
Windows Drivers Library (WDL) on various on-line services. 
Refer to the Readme file in the Drivers directory for installation 
instructions. 

The OmniBook also requires a special mouse driver for Windows. 
Windows 96 Setup will preserve and use this driver when upgrading over 
Windows 3.1. If you installed Windows 96 into a new directory 
on an OmniBook, then you must copy the HP Obmouse.drv file into the 
Windows\System directory, and then change the following lines in your 
System.ini file:

	[boot]
	mouse.drv=obmouse.drv

	[386Enh]
	mouse=*vmd

DEC Hi Note Ultra
------------------
There are known problems with PCMCIA under older BIOS versions on 
this machine. If you encounter difficulties getting your PCMCIA cards 
recognized correctly, update your BIOS to a version later than 
3/31/96 (v.1.3).

Acer Acernotes
--------------
You may hear a negative (low) tone when you insert the PCMCIA card
after activating the 32-bit PCMCIA drivers. If this happens, remove
the EMMExclude line from the System.ini file and the exclude range
data from the EMM386 line in the Config.sys file. If you still get a
low tone, try carrying out the following procedure:

1. Double-click the PCMCIA icon in Control Panel.
2. Click Global Settings, and make sure Automatic Selection is not
   checked.
3. Set the valid range to start at 000D0000 and end at 000DFFFF.  

Compaq Aero
------------
The Compaq Aero floppy disk drive is only partially supported by the 
Windows 96 PCMCIA drivers. To gain access to the floppy drive, 
you need to make sure the card is already inserted when you boot. 
After the card has been configured by Windows 96, you can remove and 
insert the card normally. 

If access to the floppy card still fails:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon, and then click the
   Device Manager tab.
2. Click the plus (+) sign next to "Floppy disk controllers."
3. Double-click the floppy disk controller you are having trouble with.
4. Look at the Device Status area. 
5. If it reports a resource conflict, click the Resources tab, 
   click the "Set Configuration Manually" button, then click OK.

DEC Venturis and Media Vision Audio Cards
-----------------------------------------
There's a known problem with certain combinations of the DEC Venturis 
and Media Vision Audio cards.

If you experience problems with this combination:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.
2. Click the Device Manager tab.
3. Under Sound, Video and Game Controllers, double-click
   Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum 16/Studio With SCSI.

5. Make sure the Enable Warm Boot box is not checked.

Zenith NoteFLEX 486DX and PC cards
-----------------------------------
If your PC cards are not being detected or working properly with the 
Windows 96 PCMCIA drivers, follow the below procedure to reserve IRQ 10
and the memory range C000-CBFF.

To reserve resources:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.
2. Click the Device Manager tab.
3. Click Computer, and then click Properties.
4. Click the Reserve Resources tab.
5. Click Interrupt Request (IRQ), and then click Add.
6. Reserve IRQ 10, and then click OK. 
7. Click Memory, and then click Add.
8. Reserve the memory range C000-CBFF, and then click OK.
9. Click OK again, and then restart your computer.

Zenith NoteFLEX 486DX and Flexshow docking station
--------------------------------------------------
If you are using the NoteFLEX with the Flexshow docking station, you 
must reserve IRQ 10 so that the built-in CD-ROM drive will work. To 
do this, follow the above procedure and only reserve IRQ 10.

In your Config.sys file, make sure the line loading Mztinit.sys 
appears before the line loading PCenable.exe or your computer will 
stop responding during startup.

Also, to avoid numerous "Bad Command or File Name" errors during 
startup and to ensure the computer is configured properly, copy 
Rplstr.com from your \Dos directory to your \Windows directory.

Zenith NoteFLEX 486DX and PCMCIA hard drives
--------------------------------------------
If you are using a PCMCIA hard drive with this computer, you must 
enable 32-bit PCMCIA support in order to access the drive.

To enable 32-bit PCMCIA support:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the PC Card (PCMCIA) icon.
2. Follow the instructions on your screen.

If you see properties for your PCMCIA socket instead of the wizard, 
Windows 32-bit support for PC cards is already turned on. If you do not 
see the PC Card (PCMCIA) icon in Control Panel, double-click the 
Add New Hardware icon in Control Panel to install your PCMCIA socket.

Megahertz Em1144T and 16-bit Modem
----------------------------------
If you experience problems setting up the modem side of this card 
in a real-mode PCMCIA environment, try explicitly setting the COMIRQ 
and COMBASE parameters in the Megahertz section of your Protocol.ini 
file. There is a known problem where this card enabler ignores the 
default values set for these parameters.

Digital Venturis (any model)
----------------------------
If PNPISA and/or PCI cards are not automatically recognized, or if 
Windows generates Blue Screen errors when reconfiguring your COM ports, 
contact Digital for a new BIOS.

Printing from Device Manager
----------------------------
If you choose to print "all devices and system summary" from Device
Manager, the device detection code MAY cause problems for MS-DOS-
based programs. The symptom of this problem is that after you print,
your computer reports that it is out of memory when you try to run 
an MS-DOS-based program. When this problem occurs, you may need to 
restart Windows to correct the problem. 

Mozart Sound Card/Canon Innova 550 CD Driver Problem
----------------------------------------------------
You may experience problems when you start up Windows 96. To receive
a new driver that works with Windows 96, contact the Canon Help Desk.

Users of TrueFFS Flash File System for PCMCIA Cards 
---------------------------------------------------
The MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 versions of the TrueFFS driver will not work 
with the Windows 96 PCMCIA driver. To work with FTL formatted Linear 
Flash PCMCIA cards when the Windows 96 PCMCIA driver is enabled, you 
must install a new Windows 96 device driver provided by M-Systems. To 
do this, carry out the following procedure:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Add New Hardware icon. 
2. Click Next, and then click the option not to have Windows search 
   for your new hardware.
3. Click Hard Disk Controllers, and then click Next.  
4. From the list, click M-Systems. 
5. Click the specific Flash Card, and then click Next. Then follow 
   the instructions on your screen.
 
NOTE: If M-Systems is not shown in the list, click Have Disk, and then
insert the M-Systems Windows 96 installation disk and follow the 
instructions on your screen.

Micronics Motherboards with a Flash BIOS
-----------------------------------------
Before installing Windows, users of Micronics motherboards with a Flash 
BIOS need to be sure the BIOS read/write jumper is set to the read-only
position. If you try to install Windows 96 with this jumper in the 
read\write position, it may cause BIOS corruption. For more information,
contact your computer manufacturer.

Toshiba Computers: T610 T400 series, T2100 series, T2400 series, 
T4700 series, T4800 series, and the T4900CT and T3600
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you use any of these Toshiba computers, Toshiba strongly recommends 
upgrading your computer's BIOS to version 5.0. The upgraded BIOS 
provides additional functionality for the Windows 96 operating system. 
For more information, in the United States contact Toshiba at 
(800) 999-4273. Outside the U.S., contact your local Toshiba dealer.

Toshiba T2150 models
---------------------
If your system stops responding during suspend or resume operations, 
comment out the line that loads the Toscdrom.sys driver from your 
Config.sys file. For example:

	rem device=c:\cddrv\toscdrom.sys

Sanyo 3-D ATAPI (IDE) CD-ROM drive
----------------------------------
The Sanyo 3-D ATAPI (IDE) CD-ROM drive uses a proprietary scheme to 
support the three-disk changer. Although all three drives will appear 
when you are running in protected mode, only one of them will be 
accessible.

To regain access to all three drives, remove the REM command from the 
beginning of the MSCDEX line in your Autoexec.bat file. You also need 
to disable the Windows 96 protected-mode disk driver. To do this, carry 
out the following procedure:

1. Click the Start button, and then point to Settings.
2. Click Control Panel, and then double-click the System icon.
3. Click the Device Manager tab.
4. Click View Devices By Connection.
5. Click plus signs next to devices until you find the Sanyo drive.
6. After you find the Sanyo drive, look at the levels above it
   until you find the parent controller.
7. Click the controller, and then click Properties.
8. In the Device Usage area, clear the check box next to the current 
   configuration.

This will enable access to all three drives from Windows 96 protected-
mode; however, your disk, CD, and any other devices under the controller
will be accessed only through real-mode drivers.

For information about updating your driver to a Windows 96 driver, 
contact your hardware vendor.

Micron PowerServer M5-PE (66 MHz Pentium PCI/EISA bus)
-------------------------------------------------------
The BusLogic BT-946C PCI SCSI adapter may not be compatible with 
Windows 96. If you encounter difficulties with your SCSI peripherals, 
contact Micron to determine whether you need an updated adapter.


SCANNERS
========

Windows 96 will detect most scanner hardware, but does not supply
protected-mode drivers for any scanner model.

All SCSI scanners use a feature called ASPI to talk to the controller
in question. Windows 96 supports ASPI in protected mode. Hence, a
scanner, although listed as an "unknown device" in Device Manager, is
supported through protected-mode drivers in Windows 96, if there is a
protected-mode driver for the SCSI controller in question.

Note that theoretically you would not need the ASPI manager real-mode
driver (such as Aspi2dos.sys) in your Config.sys file. However, some
programs, such as HP ScanJet II and its associated real-mode drivers,
Sj!!.sys and Sjiix.sys, require the real-mode ASPI manager to be in the
Config.sys file or they will fail to load. In these cases, you would
need to keep the real-mode drivers in the Config.sys file, but
Windows 96 will still support the scanner through the protected-mode
SCSI miniport driver (if one exists for the SCSI controller in question).

Logitech Scanman
----------------
If you use a handheld Logitech Scanman on a computer that has more than 
16 MB of memory, you may see the following message: "Insufficient
system resources." To resolve this problem, you can obtain an updated 
driver, Scanupt.exe, from the Logitech bulletin board or from CompuServe.


MODEMS
======

Modems Control Panel
--------------------
In order to use your modem with the built-in communications features
of Windows 96, including HyperTerminal, and Dial-Up Networking, your 
modem must be configured in Modems properties in Control Panel.

Settings made in Modems properties do not affect modem operation in
programs designed for MS-DOS or Windows 3.1.

Modem Detection
---------------
If Windows 96 detects your modem as a "Standard Modem," or incorrectly
detects its make and model, you can use the Change button in the
Install New Modem wizard to make a different selection. However, if
you manually select an incorrect type, your modem may not to work with
Windows 96 communications features. If this happens, double-click the
Modems icon in Control Panel, remove the modem, and then add it back
as one of the Standard modem types.

When configured for "Standard Modem," Windows 96 will use your modem
with its factory default settings. The modem will make optimal high-
speed connections with Windows 96 communications features. However,
you will not be able to adjust some of the modem's settings, such as
speaker volume and cellular protocols.

Racal Modems
------------
If you have a Racal modem, do not use detection in the Install New Modem
wizard. Instead, click Don't Detect My Modem, and then pick one of the
standard modem types. If you have already run detection and your modem
is not responding, turn the modem off and then back on again.

Minitel (France)
----------------
Some modems may not be able to connect to French Minitel in
HyperTerminal by using the Windows 96 default settings. To correct this,
carry out the following procedure:

1. Check your modem manual for a command that will enable your modem to
   connect in V.23 modulation to Minitel.
2. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon, click the name of
   your modem, and then click Properties.
3. Click the Connection tab, and then click Advanced.
4. In the Extra Settings box, type the command.

Modem Detection May Start AutoRun CDs
-------------------------------------
On some computers, running modem detection may start the CD Autorun 
application.

PCCard Modem Power Management: Modem Not Found or Not Ready
-----------------------------------------------------------
When PC Card Power Management is enabled, some PC card modems require 
an extra delay before they are ready. If you encounter this with your 
PC card modem, the symptoms are that it may not work when you try to 
use it, and then works if you try again right away.

To increase the delay, carry out the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, click Run, and then type Regedit.
2. Go to \HKey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Modem.
3. Click the key for the modem that you are trying to use.
4. To add a key in the root of the modem, click the Edit menu, and then 
   point to New.
5. Click DWORD Value, and create a DWord named ConfigDelay.
6. Set the value equal to "3000" for a 3-second delay. 

TAPE DRIVES
===========

Tape Drive Detection
--------------------
Plug and Play software does not detect tape drives. As a result, the
only tape drives that appear in Device Manager are SCSI tape drives,
which appear as either an unknown device or a tape drive. 

However, most backup programs do detect tape drives, so don't be
concerned if your tape drive does not appear in Device Manager. If
your backup software does not detect your tape drive, contact the
company that wrote the software.

Tape Drive Compatibility
------------------------
Microsoft Backup works only with the 1992 or later versions of the
tape drives listed below. If your tape drive does not appear in the
list below, contact your tape drive manufacturer for information about
backup software that you can use with Windows 96.

The following tape drives are compatible with Backup:
- QIC 40, 80, and 3010 tape drives made by the following companies,
  and connected to the primary floppy disk controller:
	Colorado Memory Systems
	Conner
	IOmega
	Wangtek (only in hardware phantom mode)
- Colorado Memory Systems QIC 40, 80, and 3010 tape drives connected
  through a parallel port.

The following are not compatible with Backup:
- Drives connected to a secondary floppy disk controller or to an
  accelerator card
- Archive drives
- Irwin AccuTrak tapes
- Irwin drives
- Mountain drives
- QIC Wide tapes
- QIC 3020 drives 
- SCSI tape drives
- Travan drives
- Summit drives


RUNNING ZIP TOOLS ON AN IOMEGA PARALLEL ZIP DISK
================================================

From within My Computer or Windows Explorer, if you right-click the 
ZIP drive and then click Format, the IOMEGA Format windows display 
an option for you to do a Full format of the drive. If you select 
this option, the following blue-screen fatal-exception error might 
occur:
	
     A fatal exception 0E has occurred at 0028:C3C64C51 in 
     VXD IOMEGA (01) + 00000CB5. The current application will 
     be terminated. Pressing any key closes the Explorer window.

To correct this problem, contact IOMEGA and obtain a new Iomega.vxd 
file. Using the Find command on the Start menu, find the old Iomega.vxd 
file and replace it with the newer version.

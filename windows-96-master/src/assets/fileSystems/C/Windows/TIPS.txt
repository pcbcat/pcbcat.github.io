      Contents, under "Tips and Tricks."


MS-DOS Command Prompt
---------------------

[Visual Display of Directory from Command Prompt]
If you are at a command prompt and want a visual display of a directory 
(folder), type "start .", or "start .." and an open folder of that 
directory appears on the desktop.

[Drag and Drop Filenames to Command Prompt]
You can drag file and folder icons from the desktop or a folder to an 
MS-DOS command prompt. The filename is then in the keyboard buffer
of the running MS-DOS-based application.

[Copy/Paste Information From/To Command Prompt]
Activate the toolbar in the MS-DOS-based program window to gain point-
and-click access to copy, cut, and paste operations from a Windows-based 
program to an MS-DOS-based program. For example, copy a folder output 
on the screen, and then paste it into mail.

[Starting Windows-Based Programs from a Command Prompt]
You can start Windows-based programs from a command prompt by typing the
name of the program you want to run, and then specifying any parameters as
needed. For example, to start Notepad, type "notepad" at the command prompt,
and then press Enter. You can also start Windows-based programs in
batch files.

You can also use the Start command to start a program or open a document. 
For example: C:>start Docname.ext).

[Command.pif]
If you set the properties for an MS-DOS prompt the wrong way, and you 
can't open an MS-DOS window, go into the PIF directory and edit Command.pif, 
or find Command.com and edit the properties there.

[DOSKEY]
If you want to use DOSKEY in an MS-DOS window without loading it in 
Autoexec.bat or creating a startup batch script, you can go to the
Program properties and enter doskey as the startup batch file. If you 
decide later that you want to have a real startup batch file, simply 
move DOSKEY into this batch file.

[Directory Shortcuts]
Related directories have the following shortcuts:
. = current directory 
.. = parent directory 
... = parent directory once removed directory (new in Windows 96)
.... = parent directory twice removed (new in Windows 96)
For example, if you are in the C:\Windows\System\Viewers directory,
and you enter cd... at the command prompt, the directory changes to C:\.


[Command Line Parameters]
Add a "?" to the command line of MS-DOS programs, and you will be prompted 
to add parameters when you start the program. This is especially useful 
with MS-DOS program shortcuts.


[Easy Disk Copy From the Desktop]
Create a shortcut on the desktop with diskcopy a: a: at the command prompt 
to copy a disk (substitute b: to use b: drive).



Cut, Copy, Paste, Drag and Drop
------------------------------

[Drag and Drop]
To move an object, use the left mouse button to drag the object from one 
folder to another on the same drive. Use Shift+Left-drag to force a move.

To copy an object, use the left mouse button to drag the object from one 
folder to another on a different drive. Use CTRL+Left+drag to force a copy.

To create a shortcut to an executable, use the left mouse button to drag an 
executable file to a new folder. 

Use the right mouse button to drag an 
object from one folder to another, and then select 'Create Shortcut(s) Here' 
to create a shortcut to that object. The icon annotations indicate what 
will happen: a plus sign for copy, an arrow for a shortcut, and no symbol 
for a move. Press ESC while you are dragging the object to cancel the action.

To create document shortcuts: Right drag a selection from an OLE document 
(for example, Word 96) onto the Desktop or folder, and then select 
"Create Document Shortcut Here." This document shortcut will open the 
original document at the place in the document that the shortcut originated.

To create document scraps: Use the left mouse button to drag a selection 
from an OLE document (for example, Word 96) onto the desktop or folder to 
create a scrap (a scrap is an OLE object that contains the selection). 
Drop the scrap onto another document or back onto the original document 
to insert or render it (whichever is most appropriate).

[Right Drag and Drop] 
Right drag and drop works like left drag and drop except that a menu is
displayed when you drop the object. The menu for folders displays these 
commands: Move Here, Copy Here, Create Shortcut(s) Here. The menu for OLE 
objects includes:  Create Scrap Here, Move Scrap Here, Create Document 
Shortcut Here).

[Drag to the Taskbar] 
You can drag objects from one open document to another open document 
(one covering the other) by dragging the object to the target's taskbar, 
waiting until the target window is displayed, and then dragging the object 
onto the target window.



File Operations
----------------

[Creating a New File]
Create a new file by using the right mouse button to click the desktop 
or folder, point to New, and then click the type of file you want to create
from the list. 

[Create a New Folder While Saving a File]
When using the Save As command to save a file, you can also create a new 
folder in which to store the file. Use the right mouse button to click
the dialog box list, point to New, and then click Folder. Double-click 
the new folder to open it, and then continue the save process.

[Deleting Files Without Moving them to Recycle Bin]
Select the file or files to be deleted. Use the right mouse button to click
the selection, and then hold down the Shift key and click Delete (or 
hold down the Shift key when pressing the Delete key if using the keyboard). 

[Copying and Moving Files]
Use the right mouse button to click the files you want to copy or move, 
and then click Copy or Cut. Open the destination location, and then click 
the right mouse button and select Paste.



Folders and Windows Explorer
----------------------------

[Selecting Multiple Files]
Selecting multiple files in large icon view works differently from list view.
To extend a selection, click the first icon, and then hold down the Shift 
key while you click the last icon to be selected. To change an icon from 
selected to unselected, hold down the CTRL key while you select the icon.

[Keyboard Shortcuts]
* Press Win+E to start Windows Explorer by pointing to 'My Computer'
 (on Microsoft Natural Keyboard).
* Press Backspace to display the parent folder.
* To select all files is a folder, press CTRL+A.
* Press F5 to update the contents list.

[Special Folders]
You can put the contents of Control Panel or other special folders on your
Start menu (or in any folder). Create a folder by clicking New on the
File menu, and then clicking Folder. Then, paste in the appropriate name 
as shown below:

For				Use This Name
----------------------------------------------	
Control Panel		Control Panel.{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}
Dial Up Network		Dial Up Net.{992CFFA0-F557-101A-88EC-00DD010CCC48}
Printers		Printers.{2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}

[Windows Explorer Switches]
Windows Explorer switches are useful in creating rooted folders:
 
	Explorer [/e][,/root,<object>][[,/select],<sub object>]	

/e	Use Explorer view (scope and results pane view). The default is Open 
	view (results in pane view only).	
/root<object>	Specify the object in the "normal" name space that is used 
	as the root (top level) of this Explorer/Folder (i.e., local path 
	or UNC name). The default is the Desktop).	
/Select	The parent folder opens and the specified object is selected.
<sub object>	Specify the folder unless /select is used. The default is
	the root.	

Examples: Explorer /e, /root, \\Reports  opens an Explorer window at \\Reports.
	
	  Explorer /select, C:\Windows\Calc.exe  opens a folder at
		C:\Windows (or activates one that is currently open) and
		selects Calc.exe.	
	  Explorer /e, /root, \\Source\Internal\Design\Users\David\Archive
		opens a folder to the Archive folder above. This is a good
		way to create a dedicated, remote, documents archive 
		folder. A link to this folder 
		(\\Source\Internal\Design\ Users\David\Archive) can then be
		placed in the SendTo folder for quick routing of documents.



Hardware Profiles
------------------

Hardware Profiles are used to set up multiple hardware configurations. This 
is especially useful for laptops that have docking stations or workstations
with removable storage media.

The following example demonstrates how to set up hardware profiles for a
laptop with a docking station that has this configuration:

Configuration		Docked			Undocked

and then click Rename. Type DOCKED and then click OK. Highlight the word
DOCKED and then click Copy. In the Copy Profile Dialog Box type UNDOCKED.

[To Set Up the Video Driver for Docked and Undocked Configurations]

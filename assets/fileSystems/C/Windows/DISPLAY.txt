DISPLAY ADAPTERS AND MONITORS
=============================

Windows Driver Library (WDL)
----------------------------
Windows 96 includes drivers for most display adapters. To obtain
additional or updated drivers, carry out the following procedure.


1. If you have a modem, download the driver to a floppy disk from one
   of the following online services.  

   Service                            Location of drivers
   -------                            -------------------
   The Microsoft Network              Windows 96 area
   Worldwide Web                      http://www.microsoft.com
   Gopher                             gopher://gopher.microsoft.com
   FTP                                ftp://ftp.microsoft.com
   Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)  In the United States, call 
                                      (206) 936-6735. Outside 
                                      the U.S., contact your local
                                      Microsoft subsidiary.

2. If you have the Windows 96 CD-ROM, some are available in the 
   \Drivers\Display folder. If the driver you need is in that folder, 
   proceed to step 4.

3. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the icon for
   the floppy disk drive that contains the file you downloaded,
   and then double-click the file itself. This extracts the driver.

4. Using your right mouse button, click the Windows 96 desktop, and
   then click Properties.

5. Click the Settings tab, and then click Change Display Type.

6. In the Adapter Type area, click Change, and then click Have Disk.

7. Click Browse, and then locate the file you extracted in step 3. If 
   you have the Windows 96 CD-ROM, locate the driver on the CD-ROM.

8. Click OK in the Open dialog box and in the Install From Disk 
   dialog box.

NOTE: The drivers are available at no charge; however, standard
connect-time fees and long-distance telephone charges, if any, 
apply.

Adapter Type
------------
Windows 96 Setup configures your adapter type based on the type of
controller it uses; for example, S3, Cirrus Logic, or ATI. However,
you may find a more exact match for your adapter make and model in
Display properties. To change your adapter type, open Display
properties, click the Settings tab, and then click Change Display
Type. In the Adapter Type area, click Change. 

In most cases, selecting a more precise adapter type does not change
the driver or its behavior in any way.

Monitor Type
------------
If Windows 96 does not contain your exact monitor type, select one
of the standard display types instead. This will not adversely affect
the performance or quality of Windows 96 display output.

Refresh Rates
-------------

To adjust the refresh rate in Windows 96, click the Start button,
and then point to Settings. Click Control Panel, and then double-
click the Display icon. In the Display Properties dialog box, 
click the Settings tab, and then click the Advanced Properties 
button. In the Advanced Display Properties dialog box, click the 
Adapter tab, and then select the refresh rate from the list.

To adjust the refresh rate in MS-DOS mode, you must specify your
monitor type in the adapter setup program supplied by your display
adapter or PC manufacturer. Some utilities must be included in your
Autoexec.bat file. On some PCs, monitor type is set in BIOS
configuration programs. Examples of utilities from adapter
manufacturers include:

  ATI                   Install.exe
  Cirrus Logic          Montype.exe, Clmode.exe
  Diamond Stealth       Stlmode.exe
  Diamond Stealth 64    S64mode.exe, go96.exe
  Matrox                \Mga\Setup\Setup.exe
  Tseng Labs            Vmode.exe
  Western Digital       Vgamode.exe

You may be able to obtain updated drivers that set the refresh rate
based on the selected monitor type from adapter vendors or from the
Windows Driver Library. 

Correcting Display Problems
---------------------------
In general, you can correct many display-related problems by clicking
the Graphics button on the Performance tab in System properties. Drag 
the slider in this dialog box and experiment with different settings 
before you revert to 640x480 16-color mode to work around a problem.  

In particular, if you have problems with "see through" dialogs, or
if graphic elements remain on your screen after you close a menu or 
dialog box, move the slider down one notch to "Most accelerator 
functions". This symptom can occur even on non-accelerated adapters.

NOTE: Adobe Type Manager (ATM) is not compatible with the "None"
setting in this dialog box. If Windows does not start due to this
problem, restart Windows, and then press F8 when "Starting Windows 96"
appears on your screen. Press 3 to start Windows in Safe Mode. Then
change graphics acceleration to a different setting.

Dynamic Color Change
--------------------
Most programs have no problem when you dynamically change color 
depth; however, some programs may not display colors or other 
elements correctly after a color change. To avoid this problem, 
change color depth before starting the program. If you change color 
depth while a program is running, you may need to restart the program 
to make sure the changed setting works properly.

Color Cursors
-------------
Color cursors require a Windows 96 display driver running at 256 or
more colors. They are not supported for ATI mach8 display adapters. 

If Windows 96 is not using 32-bit disk access, cursors will not
animate. You can check this setting in System properties on the
Performance tab.

PCI Display Adapters
--------------------
Your screen resolution may revert to 640x480 when Setup starts
Windows 96 for the first time. Resolution should return to your usual
settings in subsequent sessions.

IRQ Conflicts with PCI Display Adapters
---------------------------------------
If your PCI display adapter is configured by your BIOS to use IRQ 15 
and a functioning secondary PCI IDE disk controller is also configured 
to use IRQ 15 (by default), Windows 96 assigns IRQ 15 to the IDE disk 
controller. This forces your display adapter to use VGA mode. 

To load the accelerated Windows 96 driver for your display adapter, 
you must eliminate the resource conflict. One of the following 
methods should work for you:

- Obtain a BIOS upgrade from your hardware vendor. 
- If your BIOS supports it, disable the secondary PCI IDE controller 
  in the BIOS and on the Device Manager tab in System properties.
- If your BIOS supports it, disable the IRQ of the display adapter.
- If your BIOS supports it, manually reconfigure the display adapter 
  to use a different IRQ setting.

Avance Logic Display Adapters
-----------------------------
A Windows 96 driver for Avance Logic 2301 adapters (for example, 
the Hercules Stingray adapter) is available on the Windows 96 CD-ROM 
in the \Drivers\Display\Advance folder. 

The driver is also available in the Windows Driver Library. For 
more information, see the Windows Driver Library section earlier 
in this file. 

Diamond Stealth and SpeedStar 64/Pro
------------------------------------
If you have the Windows 96 CD-ROM, enhanced drivers for these 
adapters are available in the \Drivers\Display\Diamond folder. 
These enhanced drivers enable you to set refresh rate based on 
the monitor type selected in Display properties. For more 
information about how to install these drivers, see the 
Readme.txt file. 

These drivers are also available in the Windows Driver Library. 
For more information, see the Windows Driver Library section 
earlier in this file.

Diamond Viper
-------------
Windows 96 does not have a built-in driver for Diamond Viper 
adapters. However, if you install Windows 96 in the directory 
that contains your Windows 3.x files, Setup will preserve and use 
the drivers that are already there. If you install Windows 96 in 
a different directory, Setup will install the VGA driver.

If you have the Windows 96 CD-ROM, a Windows 96 driver for Diamond 
Viper VLB and PCI adapters (Weitek P9000 based) is available in the 
\Drivers\Display\Diamond folder. For more information about how to 
install these drivers, see the Readme.txt file. 

These drivers are also available in the Windows Driver Library. For 
more information, see the Windows Driver Library section earlier in 
this file.

S3 Display Adapters
-------------------
S3 adapters conflict with COM4 ports and modems. If you have modem
problems using this configuration, change your modem to a different
COM port. Or open System properties in Control Panel, click the 
Performance tab, click Graphics, and then drag the slider to None.

You can correct certain S3 display problems by adding one of the
following lines to the [Display] section of your System.ini file,
which is located in the folder that contains your Windows 96 files.
  
For problems with line and shape outline appearance, add:  
  Polygon=0       

For color problems with "High Color (16 bit)," add:                  
  HighColor=15

For color problems with "True Color (24 bit)," add:                  
  TrueColor=24

NOTE: The Windows 96 S3 driver supports 24-bit mode only at a 
resolution of 640 x 480.
 
ATI Mach8/32/64
---------------
Windows 96 cannot use high-resolution modes properly unless your
adapter is configured correctly using the ATI Install.exe program.  

Choosing the correct setting for your monitor type is especially
important. Otherwise, high-resolution modes may not be available,
or your computer may stop responding when it attempts to switch to 
them.

If your computer occasionally stops responding on PCI mach32 or 
mach64 adapters, try adding the line "outengine=0" to the [display] 
section of your System.ini file. The file is located in the folder 
that contains your Windows 96 files. If this does not work, try 
adding "VAD=1" in the same location.  This switch disables linear 
framebuffer mode, which can cause problems on some computers.

Number Nine Imagine 128
-----------------------
A driver for this adapter is available from the Windows Driver Library. 
Windows 96 will install and use the Cirrus Logic driver for these
adapters by default--limiting the maximum display settings to 800x600,
256 colors. For more information, see the Windows Driver Library section 
earlier in this file.

Hercules Graphite, Boca Vortek, Orchid Celsius (IIT AGX)
--------------------------------------------------------
The Windows 96 Setup program does not automatically install the driver
for these adapters and other adapters that use the IIT AGX controller.
To manually change to the correct display type, open Display properties
in Control Panel, click the Settings tab, and then click Change Display 
Type.

This will install the correct driver files, and enable you to select 
256-color, 16-bit color, and high-resolution modes.

Chips and Technologies
--------------------
This driver is not installed by default on some laptop computers,
including the Zenith 433. To manually install the correct driver, 
open Display properties in Control Panel, click the Settings tab, 
and then click Change Display Type.

IBM ThinkPad
------------
To run resolutions above 640x480, you must configure your ThinkPad
correctly. Check the ThinkPad utilities supplied by IBM; these are
usually located on the Start menu. 

Some older ThinkPad models require that the Ibmvesa.com driver be
loaded by your Autoexec.bat file during startup for 256-color modes
to work.

If you have a ThinkPad 755cx, open Display properties, click the
Settings tab, and then click Change Display Type. Change your display
type from "Western Digital" to "IBM ThinkPad 755cx." This will allow
the built-in panel to display 800x600 modes and may correct some
cursor-related problems.

Matrox MGA
----------
For proper operation, your adapter and monitor settings must be
correct in the Matrox setup utility, which is usually located on
your hard disk in the \Mga\Setup folder. If your computer stops
responding during startup, it may be caused by a conflict with a
network adapter.

If you encounter text problems--for example, incorrect or "garbage" 
characters--try adding "FontCache=OFF" to the [mga.drv] section of 
your System.ini file, which is located in the folder that contains 
your Windows 96 files. 

Trident Display Adapters
------------------------
If you have the Windows 96 CD-ROM, an enhanced driver for Trident 
Super VGA and accelerator adapters is available in the 
\Drivers\Display\Trident folder.

This driver is also available in the Windows Driver Library. For 
more information, see the Windows Driver Library section earlier 
in this file.

Video Logic 928Movie
--------------------
For 16-bit color modes to work correctly, make sure your display
adapter type is set to "Video Logic 928Movie" in Display properties.

Western Digital
---------------
On some laptop computers, the mouse pointer may change to a wide 
band of colored dots when you switch from a command prompt or 
MS-DOS-based program. To correct this problem, carry out the 
following procedure.

1. Click the Start button, and then point to Settings.
2. Click Control Panel, and then double-click the System icon.
3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.
4. Drag the slider to the left one notch.

SPEA Adapters
-------------
On some SPEA adapters that use an S3 controller, your Autoexec.bat
file must load a VESA TSR (for example, V7mepvbe.exe) for the
Windows 96 S3 driver to work.

Appian Renegade
---------------
Windows 96 Setup installs the VGA driver for this adapter. You can
use Windows 3.1 Renegade drivers with Windows 96, but you must turn
off the Device Bitmaps option so the drivers will operate properly.

Compaq Presario with Cirrus Logic
---------------------------------
If your Compaq Presario uses the Windows 96 Cirrus Logic driver and 
is unable to use screen resolutions higher than 640x480, check your 
Autoexec.bat file for a line similar to the following:

c:\windows\vgautil\clmode.exe t640=60 t800=0 t1024=0 t1280=0

This line indicates that 800x600, 1024x768, and 1280x1024 resolutions 
are disabled because their refresh rates are set to 0. Only 640x480, 
60 Hz is enabled. If your monitor supports higher resolutions, carry 
out the following procedure (do not modify your Autoexec.bat file 
directly).

1. Click the Start button, and then click Shut Down.
2. Click Restart The Computer, and then click Yes.
3. When the text "Starting Windows 96" appears, press and release 
   the F8 key.
4. Select Command Prompt Only, and then press ENTER.
5. At the command prompt, type the following:

	c:\windows\vgautil\clmode

6. Use the Clmode program to configure your monitor type appropriately.
7. Quit the Clmode program, and then restart your computer.

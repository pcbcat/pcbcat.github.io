STARTUP PROBLEMS
================

There is a compatibility issue with some PCI-based display adapters. 
If you have a PCI-based computer and your computer stops responding 
at any of the following times:

- On the first startup after installing your PCI display adapter
- In Safe Mode Startup
- When your display is set to 640x480, 16 colors

then you need to replace the Vga.drv file by copying 
\Drivers\Display\Vga\Vga.drv to your Windows\System directory.

If you are running Windows 96 on a 386-based computer and Windows 95
will not start even in Safe Mode, you need to replace Vga.vxd. If you
purchased Windows 96 on a CD-ROM, copy \Drivers\Display\OldVga\Vga.vxd
to your Windows\System directory. You can also get this driver from
http://www.microsoft.com.

Computers with Cyrix CPU
------------------------
If you have an Epson 866C or Microcenter Winbook computer, you may 
experience periodic general protection faults. To fix this problem:

1. Copy WB16off.exe from Windows 96 Setup Disk 1 (or if your product 
   is on CD, from the \Win96 directory) to your Windows directory.
2. Add the following line to your Autoexec.bat file:

	c:\windows\wb16off.exe
 
Micron Computers
----------------
Micron M5-P1 series: BEFORE INSTALLING WINDOWS 95, users of Micron 
M5-PI series (P-60, P-66) need to be sure that the BIOS read/write 
jumper (W22) is set to the read-only position. Setting up with this 
jumper in the read\write position may cause BIOS corruption during 
Windows 96 installation. For more information, in the United States
contact Micron Technologies at (208) 465-3434. Outside the U.S., 
contact your local hardware provider.

Micron P90 and P100: BEFORE INSTALLING WINDOWS 95, users of Micron P90 
and P100 systems need to make sure their BIOS version is N15 or later. 
For more information, in the U.S. contact Micron Technologies at 
(208) 465-3434. Outside the U.S., contact your local hardware provider.

Undefined Dynalink Error
------------------------
If you receive an "undefined dynalink" error, it's likely that a program 
you are running uses an earlier version of QuickTime that conflicts with 
the current version. To resolve this problem, you need to delete the 
QuickTime files from the program's directory. To do this, carry out the 
following procedure:
1. Restart your computer.
2. Click the Start button, click Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
3. In the Named box, type the following:
   qt*.*, *.qtc

4. Make sure the Look In box specifies your C drive, and then click
   Find Now.
5. Delete all the QuickTime files in the program's directory.
   Be sure NOT to delete any QuickTime files in the \Windows or 
   \Windows\System directories.
6. Restart your computer.

You can also contact Apple for information about QuickTime version 2.02, 
or you can download it from CompuServe.

System Detection Error -- BIOS Could Lead to Data Loss
------------------------------------------------------
If your computer displays the following message:

        System Detection

        Your computer uses a BIOS that could lead to data loss if you
        run Windows 95.

        Please update the BIOS before installing Windows 95. For more
        information, contact your computer manufacturer.

you can still install Windows 96 by carrying out the following procedure.

NOTE: Microsoft takes no responsibility for any damange that may
result from this operation.

1. Copy the contents of the Windows 96 CD-ROM (or floppy disk 1) to
   your hard disk.
2. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following:

   extract precopy2.cab msdet.inf

3. At the command prompt, type the following:

   edit msdet.inf

4. On the Search menu, click Find.
5. In the Find What box, type the following:

   [BadDSBios]

6. Click Find Now.
7. Insert a semicolon before each of the two lines following the
   [BadDSBios] heading.
8. Save your changes, and then run Setup again.

Dell Latitude XP Portable Computers with Docking Stations
---------------------------------------------------------
Some early Dell portable computers can experience problems if you start 
up while attached to a docking station and you have a PCMCIA card inserted 
in a PCMCIA slot. Although the PCMCIA card will be seen by Windows 95, the 
card will not function. To work around this problem, you should eject the 
PCMCIA card and reinsert it. The computer and PCMCIA card should recover. 
This problem is fixed in later Dell BIOS versions. For a BIOS upgrade, 
contact Dell Computer Corporation.


APPLETS
=======

Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95
------------------------------
If you install Microsoft Plus! on top of this version of Windows, it 
will not install any DriveSpace 3 components. DriveSpace 3, including 
Compression Agent, is included with this version of Windows.

Once installed, Microsoft Plus! for Windows 96 Setup will not remove 
the System Agent from an installation of this version of Windows. The 
other Plus! components will be removed if they are deselected from the 
list of components displayed during a maintenance mode installation of 
Plus!.


Backup, Known Problems
----------------------
- Backup does not work with all tape drives. If you install Backup 
  and get a message that your tape drive has not been detected, click 
  the Help button to see a list of supported tape drives.
- If a backup to tape moves less than 1.5 MB per minute, you may have a 
  conflict between the tape unit and your video card. The workaround is  
  to start the backup operation and then open a full-screen MS-DOS box 
  until the operation has finished.
- Windows 96 Help, Windows Explorer, and disk tools have links to the 
  Windows 96 Backup program. If you did not install Backup, and you 
  have the MS-DOS 5 Backup.exe file in your path, these links will 
  automatically start the MS-DOS Backup program.

Briefcase, Known Problem
------------------------
If you have Briefcase installed and then you enable user profiles (for 
multiple users on the same computer), Briefcase does not copy to each
profile correctly. To work around this problem, carry out the following 
procedure:
1. After you enable user profiles, delete the My Briefcase icon from the 
   desktop.
2. Use your right mouse button to click the desktop, click New, and then 
   click Briefcase.

HyperTerminal, Known Problems and General Information
-----------------------------------------------------
- If a session is open, HyperTerminal does not recognize when a 
  PCMCIA modem is inserted.
- When receiving a file, HyperTerminal does not know if the disk 
  is full.
- To use the CTRL keys for Cut, Copy, and Paste in HyperTerminal, you 
  need to use Windows keys instead of Terminal keys. To change this
  setting, in HyperTerminal, click the Settings tab.
- In File Transfer, HyperTerminal does not send files with attributes
  marked as System or Hidden.
- If a Windows 3.1 TAPI service provider is already installed on your
  system when you upgrade to Windows 95, you will experience problems
  with HyperTerminal. To work around these problems, you can use the 
  Telephony icon in Control Panel to  remove and then reinstall the 
  TAPI service provider, or you can run the utility Tapiutil.exe. You 
  can download Tapiutil.exe from CompuServe, ftp.microsoft.com, or 
  www.microsoft.com.

ScanDisk, Known Problems
------------------------
- If you have created or named files or folders while using different
  code pages, ScanDisk may report errors about these files or the 
  folders they reside in. If you are affected by this, open ScanDisk's 
  Advanced dialog box and make sure Check Files For Invalid File Names 
  is not checked. Note that turning off this option may inhibit 
  ScanDisk's ability to detect or repair seriously damaged folders.

WordPad, Known Problem
----------------------
- File/Print Preview may not show the page layout accurately, but 
  the line breaks are shown accurately.


LARGE DISK SUPPORT (FAT32)
==========================

Introduction
------------
The File Allocation Table (FAT) file system has been the primary 
disk format used by MS-DOS-based and Windows-based personal computers 
since 1981. FAT is a fast and broadly supported disk format, but until 
now, it has been unable to support single drives over 2 gigabytes (GB). 
A gigabyte is equal to 1,024 megabytes, or approximately 1.07 billion 
bytes. 

This product includes support for an enhanced version of the FAT 
file system, FAT32, that supports drives up to 2 terabytes 
(approximately 2,000 GB). It also allocates space on the drive in 
smaller units (called clusters) than earlier versions of FAT, 
resulting in more efficient use of space on the drive.

This section addresses some of the known issues with FAT32, and 
answers some of the questions you might have.

Compatibility
-------------
FAT32 is designed to be fully compatible with existing computers and 
programs designed to run on earlier versions of MS-DOS and Windows. 
However, many existing disk utilities (programs that perform low-level 
maintenance tasks on disks, such as disk compression or repair tools 
and defragmenters) will need to be updated in order to work with FAT32 
drives. The disk tools contained with Windows, including ScanDisk, 
Backup, and Disk Defragmenter, fully support FAT32 drives. FAT32 
drives cannot be compressed by using DriveSpace, however.

In addition, operating systems other than this version of Windows are 
unable to access information stored on FAT32 drives. This includes the 
original version of Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 and earlier, and previous 
versions of MS-DOS and Windows. However, this version of Windows does 
support accessing FAT32 drives in MS-DOS mode. In addition, FAT32 drives 
can be shared over a network and accessed by remote computers in the 
same way as older-style FAT drives, even if the remote computers don't 
support FAT32.

Known Problems
--------------

Running Interlink on a FAT32 drive
----------------------------------
If you are running Interlink as a server on a FAT32 drive, all 
connections and inquiries (such as DIR) result in the following 
error message: "File allocations table bad, Drive X." Also, the 
Interlink "manager" shows the incorrect total drive size.

This problem does not occur on FAT16 drives. To see your FAT32 
server, start your computer in protect mode with Interlink running.

Incorrect free disk space reported by programs
----------------------------------------------
Programs not developed specifically for this version of Windows 
may be unable to report free space accurately on large hard disks 
that use FAT32. Older programs are unable to report more than 2 GB 
of free or total disk space, and many will report incorrect amounts 
of free, total, or used space on large hard drives. Windows 96 
version 4.00.950 B provides new MS-DOS and Win32 APIs that programs 
can use to determine free or total disk space over 2 GB. 

Save to File (Hibernate) feature 
may be incompatible with FAT32
--------------------------------
On computers containing a BIOS made by Phoenix Technologies, you 
might not be able to use the Save to File feature if your primary 
(boot) drive is formatted using FAT32. If your PhDISK utility is 
earlier than version 5.0, you must obtain an updated version of the 
utility and an updated ROM BIOS from your computer manufacturer in 
order to use a Save to Disk file. 

With older versions of the ROM BIOS, your computer may be unable to 
start if it tries to read a Save to Disk file from a FAT32 drive. If 
this occurs, you must disable the Save to File feature in your ROM BIOS. 
This does not affect computers using a disk partition to store the Save 
to Disk data.  

Ontrack Systems Disk Manager
----------------------------
If you use the Ontrack Systems Disk Manager program on a computer with 
FAT32 drives, there might be a long pause when you start your computer 
and/or the drive will be set to run in compatibility mode. If you use 
version 7.0x, you can avoid this pause by using the /L=0 option with 
Disk Manager. To do this, carry out the following steps:

1. Start your computer normally, and then run Disk Manager.

2. Click the Maintenance menu, and then click Update Dynamic Drive 
   Overlay.

3. Add /L=0 to any other options that are already present.

4. Save the settings, and then restart your computer.

If you are running an earlier version of Disk Manager and you want 
to use FAT32, you should update to version 7.04 or later and use 
the /L=0 switch.

V Communications System Commander
---------------------------------
Versions 2.28 and earlier of V Communications System Commander are 
incompatible with FAT32. If your primary (boot) hard disk uses FAT32 
exclusively, you must obtain version 3 or later of System Commander.

Iomega Jaz tools may be incompatible with FAT32
-----------------------------------------------
If you format an Iomega Jaz disk using FAT32, you may need to obtain 
updated versions of the Jaz tools. Older versions of the tools do not 
support FAT32 Jaz disks properly. As a result, the eject, write-
protection, and password-protection options will be disabled. Updated 
versions of these tools that are compatible with FAT32 are available 
from Iomega, and from the Microsoft Windows Driver Library contained 
on the Windows CD-ROM disk and available for download from various 
on-line services.

SyQuest Techology, Inc. device drivers
--------------------------------------
Older versions of the Squatdvr.sys and Sqdriver.sys device drivers 
are incompatible with this version of Windows and will hang when 
your computer starts if your primary (boot) disk uses FAT32. You 
must remove the associated DEVICE= line from your Config.sys file 
in order to start your computer from a FAT32 drive. Updated versions 
of these drivers that are compatible with FAT32 are available from 
SyQuest, and from the Microsoft Windows Driver Library contained on 
the Windows CD-ROM disk and available for download from various 
on-line services.

Questions and Answers
---------------------

How do I tell if a drive is a FAT32 drive?
------------------------------------------
In My Computer, right-click the icon that represents your hard 
disk, and then click Properties. The kind of drive you are using 
is indicated after the word Type at the top of the screen.

How do I enable FAT32?
----------------------
If you obtained this version of Windows with a new computer system, 
it may already be using the FAT32 disk format. If not, or if you 
add a new hard disk to your computer and you want to use the FAT32 
file system, you enable it by running the FDISK program. FDISK is 
a program used to create or delete one or more partitions on a hard 
disk. A partition is a section of a hard disk that appears to be a 
single disk drive. Most hard disks must be partitioned with FDISK 
before they can be used with Windows. If your computer has a disk 
drive larger than 512 megabytes (MB), when you run FDISK it will 
prompt you whether to enable large disk support. If you answer yes, 
then any partition you create that is over 512 MB will use the FAT32 
file system. If you answer no, then you will be unable to create disk 
partitions larger than 2GB. After creating a partition with FDISK, 
you must restart your computer and then format the drive before you 
can store data on it.

IMPORTANT NOTE: FDISK is an extremely powerful program. If you delete 
a disk partition by using FDISK, all the data in that partition will 
be permanently destroyed. If you are unfamiliar with FDISK, you may 
want to consult a qualified computer technician before using it.

Is FAT32 faster than earlier versions of FAT?
---------------------------------------------
In general, no. In most cases, your computer will perform about 
the same if your hard disk is formatted by using FAT32 as it did 
previously. In some cases, however, performance may be worse than 
with the original version of FAT.

Note that FAT32 drives may be significantly slower when your 
computer is running is MS-DOS mode or when you are running Windows 
in Safe Mode. If you use MS-DOS mode with FAT32 drives, you may find 
that performance is improved significantly by loading the Smart Drive 
disk-caching program.

What size clusters are used on FAT32 drives?
--------------------------------------------
The following cluster sizes are typically used on FAT32 drives:

        Drive size        Cluster size
        -----------       ------------
       <260 MB            512 bytes
        260 MB -  8 GB      4 kilobytes (KB)
          6 MB - 16 GB      8 KB
         16 MB - 32 GB     16 KB
        >32 GB             32 KB

Can I use disk compression on FAT32 drives?
-------------------------------------------
No. DriveSpace 3 does not support compressing FAT32 drives.


DISK TOOLS
==========

- If you create a Briefcase and then compress a drive that contains
  files to which it refers, the Briefcase's association to the files
  will be lost. The files will still exist, but you will need to
  reassociate them with the Briefcase.
- If you use INTERLNK, do not use ScanDisk, DriveSpace, or the Disk 
  Defragmenter to operate on a drive on a remote computer.
- AT&T Mail versions 2.5 and earlier will install a TSR that prevents 
  disk utilities from being able to repair disks. If you are running 
  one of these earlier versions, contact AT&T for information about 
  their latest release.


DISKS AND CDs
=============

- The NEC 260GW ATAPI CD-ROM that shipped with older Gateway computers
  is now supported through protect-mode drivers. In order for protect
  mode support to work, the real-mode driver needs to be loaded in
  Config.sys. 
- The NEC 3X, firmware version 2.2, can give bad data and is not supported
  by Windows 95.


DRIVERS
=======

The Windows Driver Library (WDL) is included on the Drivers directory on
the Windows 96 CD. Check this directory if you need a driver that is not
included in Windows 95. Included in this directory are miniports for 
Trantor and QLogic SCSI adapters.

EZ-Drive
--------
EZ-Drive is supported through the protected-mode IDE driver.

Adaptec EZ SCSI
---------------
Adaptec EZ SCSI Windows version will not run. The MS-DOS version will
work with Windows 95.

Aspidisk.sys
------------
If your computer uses the Aspidisk.sys device driver in Config.sys to 
provide MS-DOS mode support for a SCSI disk, version 4.01 or later of 
Aspidisk.sys is required in order to support disks formatted with FAT32. 
A FAT32-compatible version of this driver is available from Adaptec. 
It is also available in the Microsoft Windows Driver Library, which is 
in the Drivers directory on the Windows 96 CD-ROM disk, or you can 
download it from various on-line services.

Arco AcideJL
------------
If you are using this adapter, the driver AcideJL.386 causes a conflict 
when Windows 96 is installed from earlier versions of Windows. However, 
you can install Windows 96 from MS-DOS.

Promise 2300+ Drivers
---------------------
MS-DOS (Eide2300.sys): Works fine; you can get extra performance by 
installing this driver.

Windows 3.1 (Eide2300.386): Works fine, but does not add any value. 
Setup removes this driver.

Windows 96 (Ptivgapi.mpd): This driver is still in beta and its use 
is not recommended at this time. 

Syquest Sqatdrv.sys and Sqdriver.sys Drivers
--------------------------------------------
The Sqatdrv.sys driver may cause systems containing FAT32 drives to hang 
during startup. Remove this driver from the Config.sys file if you are using 
FAT32 drives on a system with this device driver. Versions of these drivers 
that are compatible with FAT32 boot drives will be added to the Windows 
Driver Library (on the Windows CD and downloadable from the Internet) 
shortly.


PRINTING
========

Compaq Prolinea or DeskPro computers
------------------------------------
If you have one of the Compaq Prolinea or DeskPro models listed 
following this topic, and you are using a parallel attached printer 
that supports bidirectional communications (such as the HP LaserJet 
Series 4 & 5 printers, some Lexmark LaserPrinters, and possibly others), 
you may experience problems resulting in timeout errors when printing. 
To correct this problem, copy a newer LPT driver (Lpt.vxd) from the 
\Drivers\Printers\Lpt directory of the Windows 96 CD to your 
\Windows\System directory. You can also obtain this file from the 
Windows Driver Library. If the problem persists, make sure that the 
ECP port on your computer is configured for DMA channel 3. To do this, 
look up "DMA channel" in the Windows Help Index.

	Compaq Prolinea 4100
	Compaq Prolinea 5100
	Compaq Prolinea 5120
	Compaq Prolinea 5133
	Compaq Prolinea 575
	Compaq Prolinea 590
	Compaq DeskPro 450
	Compaq DeskPro 466
	Compaq DeskPro 4100

	Compaq DeskPro 5120
	Compaq DeskPro 5133
	Compaq DeskPro 575
	Compaq DeskPro 590


REMOVABLE MEDIA
===============

Syquest Removable IDE Cartridge
-------------------------------
This is supported. You need to add the following line to the [386enh]
section of your system.ini file:
	RemovableIDE=1


UPDATED DIALING RULES
=====================

This release includes updated dialing rules for local, long distance, 
and international calls in several countries. These updates (1) correct 
problems in the original release of Windows 96 and (2) implement new 
dialing rules for countries that have changed their dialing rules since 
the original release of Windows 95.

During Setup, the updated rules are automatically inserted into the 
[CountryOverrides] section of the Telephon.ini file in the Windows 
directory.

New Dialing Rules Not Yet in Effect
-----------------------------------
The update includes dialing rule changes for France, Finland, and 
Colombia. However, these new dialing procedures have not yet actually 
gone into effect in these countries. (The Colombia change is in 
September 1996, and France and Finland in October 1996). The changes 
are included now in anticipation of these future changes, because by 
the time the systems preloaded with this final product reach store 
shelves in these countries, the changes will have gone into effect.

Reverting to Current Dialing Rules
----------------------------------
If you will be testing this product in France, Finland, or Colombia 
before the new dialing procedures are effective, you will need to use 
Notepad (or another text editor) to modify your Telephon.ini file. To 
do this, carry out the following steps:

1. Make a backup copy of your Telephon.ini file (for instance, 
   Telehon.sav). 
2. Open the Telephon.ini file in Notepad (or another text editor).
3. In the [CountryOverrides] section, remove the line that corresponds 
   to the country for which you want to revert to the existing dialing 
   procedures.

   For example, to revert to the current rules for France, delete the 
   line that starts with "Country33=".

4. Restart your computer.




MICROSOFT FAX
=============

You need a Class 1 fax modem to take advantage of advanced security
features and to exchange editable binary files using Microsoft Fax.
You can use Class 2 fax modems to send and receive traditional Group 3
faxes.

The first time you start a portable PC with a new hardware 
configuration, Windows 96 may start with all printers off line. This 
includes the fax printer. To correct this problem, do the following:
1. Click the Start menu, and then click Settings.
2. Click Printers, and then double-click the icon for the Microsoft
   Fax printer.
3. On the Printer menu, make sure that Work Offline is not checked.

If you are using your computer as a Microsoft Fax NetFax server, do
not shut down or log off of Microsoft Exchange or Windows 96 while 
faxes are being sent or are still in the fax queue.

While fax is in automatic answer mode, programs that are not TAPI-
enabled will not be able to use the modem. This includes all 16-bit 
communication programs. By default, Microsoft Fax is set up to let 
a 16-bit program use the modem and will not automatically answer 
incoming faxes. If you do not use other 16-bit communication programs 
and you want to have Microsoft Fax automatically answer all incoming 
calls as fax calls, do the following:
1. Right click the fax machine icon, located on the taskbar near the 
   clock.
2. Click Modem Properties.
3. Change the answer mode to Answer After 3 Rings.

Individual phone systems and different modems may differ in the amount
of time they need to answer incoming fax calls. Setting the answer mode   
to answer after three rings may actually result in the phone's being  
answered after two or four rings. If you experience this problem, you 
can adjust the minimum number of rings either higher or lower to   
compensate for these differences.

CAS modems, such as the Intel Satisfaxion 200i, Satisfaxion 400i, and 
GammaLink CAS modems, are not supported. A firmware revision is  
available from Intel for the Satisfaxion 400i that will convert this  
modem to be Class 1 compatible. For more information, contact Intel.

Do not manually change any of the printer spool settings on the   
properties sheet or the Microsoft Fax printer.

Microsoft Fax is recommended only for computers with at least 8 MB of 
memory.

When you send a fax by using the Microsoft Exchange New Message form,
you cannot have the fax message on the cover page. To send a
one-page fax with your fax message on the cover page, you must use
the Send Fax wizard. To open the Send Fax wizard, click the Compose
menu in Microsoft Exchange, and then click the New Fax menu. Or, click 
the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then
click the Fax folder. If you are faxing only a short note,
performance is better when you put the note on the cover page.

To include a message on the cover page, the cover page must contain
the note field. If the note field is not present, the message
appears on the second page of the fax.

The network fax server component of Microsoft Fax has only been tested
and known to work with Microsoft File and Printer Sharing for 
Microsoft Networks or Microsoft File and Printer Sharing for NetWare
Networks.

If you change a setting in Microsoft Fax while Microsoft Exchange is  
running, the change will probably not take effect until you log off
and exit from Microsoft Exchange, and then restart it.

If you send a fax to a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 At Work Fax user,
and the message includes multiple recipients on the Cc: list, the
only addresses that will be visible on the fax user's message are
the fax addresses. However, all messages will be sent correctly.

The File Send command in some programs may not work properly. This 
includes Microsoft Works version 3.0, Lotus 1-2-3, Aldus Pagemaker, 
and others. If you cannot reliably send a fax by using the File Send 
command, either attach the file to a fax or use the File Print 
command from within the program.

When you use the fax configuration properties sheet to browse to a
cover page, a link (.lnk) to this cover page is created in your
Windows directory. If you already have a cover page (.cpe) in your
Windows directory with the same name, this name will appear in the
cover pages list twice, but you can select only one of them. It is
recommended that you delete one of the files by using Windows Explorer.

If you send an editable fax to a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 At Work
Fax user, the fax recipient may not see any names on the Cc or Bcc line
if the message was sent to duplicate or non-Fax addresses. However, the
message will be delivered to all recipients.

If you are using the Microsoft NetFax service for faxing, and you use 
the Microsoft Fax "Request a Fax" program to retrieve a fax, the 
returned information wil be sent to the NetFax server. It will then 
have to be forwarded to you manually by the system administrator. 


PEN SERVICES
============

Microsoft Corp. distributes Pen Services for Windows 96 through the
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) channel. As such, the Windows
96 product does not include Pen Services for Windows 95.

Contact your pen hardware OEM for your Pen Services for Windows 96 
upgrade.


MS-DOS MODE
===========

The MS-DOS Share program (Share.exe) is not included in this version 
of Windows. Share support is provided to all programs running under 
Windows, but programs that require share support cannot be run in 
MS-DOS mode using this version of Windows.


MS-DOS MEMORY MANAGEMENT
========================

To maximize the amount of memory available to MS-DOS programs, add 
the following line to your Config.sys file:

	buffers=13

On most computers, this will free up approximately 16K of conventional 
or upper memory for use by MS-DOS programs or device drivers. Note, 
however, that this command reduces the number of MS-DOS buffers, so it 
might adversely affect disk performance when your computer is running 
in MS-DOS mode.


MS-DOS CODE PAGE
================

Depending on the country selected, Windows 96 automatically uses 
MS-DOS code page 437 or 850. If you need to use a different code 
page, such as 861 or 865, use the Changecp.exe utility program. 
This program is included in the Windows 96 Resource Kit and the 
CD-ROM version of Windows 95. It is also available from the 
Microsoft Download Service or from your local Microsoft subsidiary.


ONTRACK SYSTEMS DISK MANAGER
============================
If you use Ontrack Systems' Disk Manager on a computer that is booting 
from a FAT32 drive, it may result in a long pause at startup, and/or 
that the drive will be set to run in compatibility mode. With version 
7.0x, you can Use the /L=0 option with Disk Manager to avoid this pause. 
If you are running an earlier version of Disk Manager, you should update 
to version 7.04 and use the /L=0 switch if you use FAT32.

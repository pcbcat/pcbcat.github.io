Support
========

Much information about The Microsoft Network (MSN) is available 
online. You can find answers to many of your questions in the 
Frequently Asked Questions and MSN Questions and Answers documents. 
You can find these documents by clicking Member Assistance and then 
double-clicking the MSN Support folder for your area. If you are 
unable to find the answer you need, you can post a question in one 
of the MSN support bulletin boards in this same area, and someone 
from Microsoft product support will assist you.


Modem Information
=================

- Make sure to change MSN modem properties by double-clicking the 
  MSN icon on your desktop, clicking Settings, and then clicking 
  Modem Settings. Do not use the Modems Control Panel to change 
  modem settings for MSN, since MSN overrides some Control Panel 
  modem settings. 

- If the modem installation wizard selected a "Standard Modem" driver, 
  this means it could not determine what kind of modem you have. If 
  this happens, and if you are having trouble connecting or experience 
  dropped connections, and your modem is Hayes-compatible, remove the 
  Standard Modem driver and choose a Hayes Compatible modem driver. On 
  the Start menu, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click 
  the Modems icon, select the Standard Modem, and then click Remove. 
  Then click Add, and check Don't Detect My Modem, and click Next. 
  Under Manufacturers, select Hayes, and choose the "Hayes Compatible" 
  model. If you still are having problems, contact Customer Service 
  (see next section).

	
If You Have Trouble Connecting to MSN or Finding Online Support
===============================================================

Try using the Signup and Access Troubleshooter. Use your right mouse
button to click The Microsoft Network icon on your desktop, and then
click Connection Settings. Click Help.

If you have trouble connecting while trying to sign up for a member ID,  
you may be in an area that is not supported by the Microsoft toll-free 
signup number. If this happens, your modem will try to connect several 
times without success. When the Connection Settings dialog box appears, 
follow these steps:

1. Click Access Numbers and then for both the primary and backup phone 
   numbers, click Change, and choose a number in your calling area. 

2. Click Try Again in the Connection Settings dialog box, and then try
   to connect again. 

If you are still unable to connect, contact Microsoft Customer Service. 
You can look up the Customer Service phone number for your country in 
the Signup and Access Troubleshooter (see above instructions) or by 
using your right mouse button to click The Microsoft Network icon on 
your desktop. Click Properties, and then scroll through the text. 

If you can't reach Customer Service by using the number listed for 
your country, try the number listed in "Other countries" for your 
region.


Running The Microsoft Network From a Server
===========================================

If you connect to another computer, you cannot run The Microsoft
Network from it. You can run it only from your computer.
